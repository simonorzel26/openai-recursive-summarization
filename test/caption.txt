Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all
day going all right how are you sir good
man how are you doing very nice to meet
you yeah nice to meet you too what is it
like uh running for vice president of
the United States how crazy is this
experience uh it&amp;#39;s pretty weird it&amp;#39;s
pretty weird uh you know I was just
telling you this earlier but the first
time that I&amp;#39;ve been in a public spot
without Secret in the room is right now
so I&amp;#39;m like looking around for these
guys because I&amp;#39;m used to having them
it&amp;#39;s 3 months right so he he asked me
the Monday of the RNC convention which I
think was June
15th and I really didn&amp;#39;t know that
morning I thought that he was probably
going to pick me but I didn&amp;#39;t know for
sure probably 6040 basically and so I
had no idea I get the call around 1:00
at Milwaukee time at the RNC convention
I&amp;#39;m hanging out with my kid another one
of my kids is in the other room asleep
cuz you know our kids are young so they
nap still and uh he makes this call and
he&amp;#39;s like hey do you want to be my vice
president I was like was it literally
just like that well actually what what
happened is I get a text message from a
staff member on his team that says he
just missed a very important phone call
and I don&amp;#39;t know you know cuz there&amp;#39;s so
much inbound traffic that I think it
just went straight to voicemail so I
call him back and I&amp;#39;m like Hey sir
what&amp;#39;s going on he said JD you just
missed a very important phone call I&amp;#39;m
going to have to pick somebody else
now you know so I&amp;#39;m about to a
brick here and then he says no no I&amp;#39;m
just kidding obviously want you to be my
vice president and the the funny thing
is you know my seven-year-old is in the
background and he has no idea what&amp;#39;s
going on and I love that right it&amp;#39;s one
of the good things about this he has no
clue what&amp;#39;s going on he&amp;#39;s like Daddy who
are you talking to he&amp;#39;s talking about
Pokemon cards right and um I you know
Trump hears my son in the background and
he says well uh who&amp;#39;s that and I said
that&amp;#39;s my seven-year-old son you and
he&amp;#39;s like put him on the phone
and I&amp;#39;m just anxious for him to get this
statement out because in my mind it&amp;#39;s
not final until the statement is
actually out and he he he talks to my
son and and he reads the statement that
he is going to put out on Truth social
announcing that I&amp;#39;m the VP nominee of
the Republican party and he&amp;#39;s like what
do you think about that Yuan and my son
y&amp;#39;s like oh that&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s pretty
good that&amp;#39;s pretty good he gives the
phone back to me he&amp;#39;s like I have no
idea what the hell is going on he
doesn&amp;#39;t that means he has no idea and
and of course I remember this story
because
because in particular and the Madison
Square Garden rally of a few days ago
was the first time that my son actually
met Donald Trump so he&amp;#39;d spoken to him
on the phone but hadn&amp;#39;t actually met him
until the rally at MSG and my
seven-year-old really wanted to tell him
a joke and he remembers this phone
conversation and so he tells him this
joke and Trump kind of Chuckles but also
is probably judging me because it was
somewhat inappropriate joke for a
seven-year-old to tell but yeah here we
are well that&amp;#39;s the only ones
seven-year-olds remember
that&amp;#39;s right well it&amp;#39;s like you know I
have a I have terrible language it&amp;#39;s
it&amp;#39;s one of my my many flaws but I was
raised by my very workingclass
grandmother and she was actually very
interestingly she was a very devout
Christian but she also had you know a
language that would make a sailor blush
and so I talk like that because I was
raised by this woman those are fun
ladies those are fun ladies and she was
a great she was she was awesome uh she
had an amazing she&amp;#39;s an amazing person a
huge personality right we called her a
force of nature because she was such
this this big personality but my wife&amp;#39;s
rule is you know basically he&amp;#39;s only
allowed to cuss when he&amp;#39;s telling this
one joke so oh that&amp;#39;s hilarious he
told exactly he says it 14 times a day
yeah I early on I told my kids you can
swear in front of us like go but don&amp;#39;t
just don&amp;#39;t swear in front of other
parents and don&amp;#39;t swear for no reason
right well because they judge you right
the other parents judge you how old are
your kids well the the youngest ones are
14 and 16 and I have a 28-year-old but
when my uh 14-year-old was two we were
on a skiing trip and uh we we were about
to leave we packed up all our stuff but
her helmet we forgot to put her helmet
away I go ah we forgot to put the helmet
away and she just looks down at the
helmet and she goes
 and me and my wife is just like oh
my God it was so funny there&amp;#39;s just
something adorable about a 2-year-old
that doesn&amp;#39;t know that you&amp;#39;re not
supposed to say just that cute
little face well I mean my my uh my
four-year-old he was three at the time
we were going cuz you know we live in
Cincinnati but then I&amp;#39;m a senator so we
spent a lot of time in Washington and I
was taking my four-year-old solo he was
three at the time on this trip and we&amp;#39;re
on like a Delta flight we&amp;#39;re in the back
I&amp;#39;m kind of wondering cuz you know I&amp;#39;ve
got bed head and I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself
do any of these people know that I&amp;#39;m a
senator cuz I look like right now
and my sort of geta away with it I don&amp;#39;t
think that anybody notices who I am and
we&amp;#39;re sitting there and my son drops one
of those bis cof cookies in between the
the seat and he looks at me and he says
Dad well
 and like 12 people instantly turn
around and look at me it&amp;#39;s like oh
Senator Vance your son has such colorful
language I&amp;#39;m like oh my God I&amp;#39;m such a
terrible father and these people are all
judging me yeah but it&amp;#39;s you know but
you&amp;#39;re right it&amp;#39;s so cute Ador yeah it&amp;#39;s
it&amp;#39;s so funny but yeah I got to do a
little bit better about that because
they&amp;#39;re going to start judging me people
need to relax
little bad words every now and then it&amp;#39;s
good for you I think it&amp;#39;s good for you I
gets a little steam out I agree it&amp;#39;s
good do did was there any part of you
that was like do I really want this job
because it comes with so much it comes
with not having the Secret Service in
the room it comes with this enormous
change of your life this insane

in head over to call of duty.com
BlackOps 6 to get in the game Call of
Duty Black Ops 6 available now uh it
really is amazing I mean one of the
first times that I I sort of spent like
a large amount of time with Trump was in
2021 and I was thinking about running
for the Senate so I was down in Mar Lago
talking to him and my initial reaction
on seeing him was like oh my God God you
look really good you actually look
healthier now than you did 6 years ago
normally president&amp;#39;s age very very badly
you know yeah I mean look I I I
definitely thought okay obviously this
is a big it&amp;#39;s a big thing right and my
you know talked about it with my wife a
lot because she&amp;#39;s like a she was a
working corporate litigator she&amp;#39;s got a
very big career she&amp;#39;s much smarter than
I am and we definitely it was a marital
conversation some ways a tough one
because you know even though yeah I&amp;#39;m a
senator we&amp;#39;re still pretty Anonymous
right like we can go on vacation or we
were till this happened we go on
vacation yeah you&amp;#39;d have people stop and
ask take a photo or say something you
know nice but most most people if you
went somewhere didn&amp;#39;t know who you were
right now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s literally impossible
for us to go anywhere what&amp;#39;s that shift
feel like like you&amp;#39;re 40 years old right
so yeah I I mean like right like this
just off a cliff complete different life
yeah that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s right I mean
it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been I mean look in some
ways it&amp;#39;s really nice because people
come up and say really nice things to
you they tell you you&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re praying
for your kids they&amp;#39;re praying for for
your
family doesn&amp;#39;t it like if you go through
yeah no of course yeah um uh through
like the super woke blue haired parts of
Brooklyn you know it&amp;#39;s interesting when
we were in New York for the MSG rally a
few people saw me and flashed the
universal New York sign for we&amp;#39;re number
one right so you know they like us even
New York City but it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
definitely weird to just not be
anonymous at all anymore right and
that&amp;#39;s taken some getting used to I I
think part of it is also so let me just
give an example so Sunday morning we
want to go for this is the this is the
event Madison Square Garden we had the
morning where I didn&amp;#39;t really have
anything going on had a couple phone
calls so we want to go for a walk with
the kids in Central Park and normally
you would walk out of your hotel and
walk into Central Park and hang out with
your family now what requires we have to
notify Secret Service and so then they
have to scope out an area where they can
make sure that it&amp;#39;s going to be properly
safe and so instead of walking out our
hotel room and taking a walk in Central
Park we hop in a car and show up in some
in a part of Central Park that&amp;#39;s 20
blocks away and then of course as soon
as we get out everybody&amp;#39;s like well who
the hell is this because there are 14
car motorcade there so the lack of
anonymity is definitely an annoyance
that comes along with it but I I mean I
I I&amp;#39;m the kind of person where you just
take the good with the bad there are a
lot of benefits to it there are some
downsides to it it&amp;#39;s what I ask for I
try not to think too much about it or
complain too much about it I just try to
accept it I think obviously if we win
which you know 6 days from now I think
we are going to win I think we&amp;#39;ll have
to sort of get into more of a routine
with it my attitude thus far has been
well it&amp;#39;s only for a few months so you
can do anything for a few months is the
adjustment um is it like is it difficult
was it pretty easy did you just accept
it like this is how life is now well
it&amp;#39;s you just you have to accept it but
it&amp;#39;s not easy right I mean in particular
for our kids right like okay I really
like to drive and 99% of the time that
if we&amp;#39;re as a in the car as a family I&amp;#39;m
driving my wife&amp;#39;s in the passenger seat
just cuz I like to drive
and I think for our kids getting used to
oh we&amp;#39;re not going into our car we&amp;#39;re
going into this black SUV and daddy&amp;#39;s
not driving right there&amp;#39;s some other
person there they don&amp;#39;t know right yeah
or you know like one of the first things
that happened we&amp;#39;re back at our house in
Cincinnati the the weekend after the RNC
convention and we&amp;#39;re sitting there
watching like some stupid show Emily and
Paris on Netflix or something which
sorry I don&amp;#39;t mean to call that a stupid
show I actually think Emily and Paris is
a masterpiece but set that to the side
bracket that one for now um but watching
some Show on Netflix and you know you
just you see one guy walk past your your
window and you see another guy walk past
your window and it&amp;#39;s just a secret
service agent patrolling just little
things like that so you know it just you
recognize that your zone of privacy is
very narrow and that takes some
adjusting and getting used to and you
know there are all of these these small
little adjustments but by and large
honestly like I love our secret service
detail our kids are really into them
they sort of see them as their their
police protectors our seven-year-old
it&amp;#39;s funny you know he&amp;#39;s in second grade
and one of his buddies their their
parents came to us and said do you know
that the kids are playing this game in
school called uh called boss man where
basically one second grader will walk
down the hallway or on down the
playground flanked by two separate
second graders like they&amp;#39;re playing
secret service now playing secret
service now school so like on the one
hand that&amp;#39;s really bizarre and I hope
that it doesn&amp;#39;t permanently screw up the
psychological development of my kid on
the other hand it&amp;#39;s kind of funny and
you just go with the flow and you try to
work with it yeah I guess they&amp;#39;re just
making fun with it yeah is like did you
have presidential aspirations before all
this is this something that you had
considered about the future was it like
how how did you approach this yeah I
mean you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one of these things
when you&amp;#39;re elected to the Senate and
you know I&amp;#39;m a pretty young guy I think
it was I&amp;#39;m the second youngest United
States Senator right now you certainly
think like is this something I might do
in the future what does this look like
what would you need to do in terms of
getting your family in in the right
mental space and just making it happen
but it&amp;#39;s all very abstract right it&amp;#39;s
it&amp;#39;s not all that different from you
know 10 years ago thinking about
starting a business that I never started
right it&amp;#39;s just things you think about
but you never really think that hard
about right and that&amp;#39;s kind of that was
kind of my attitude towards it I I
started to realize that Trump was
thinking pretty seriously about making
me his VP nominee probably earlier this
year because he would ask me a lot about
who I thought the VP nominee should be
oh boy and i&amp;#39; you know exactly and i&amp;#39;
give
him and I&amp;#39;d give him names of people
that I thought would be pretty good at
it and a lot of the names that I gave
him he would he would criticize and I
almost felt like he was inviting me to
throw myself out there but the I mean
it&amp;#39;s
funny the morning that he was shot in in
uh Butler PA was the first time that he
and I ever talked about it it so that
was a Saturday just think thinking about
I guess it was probably June 13th cuz I
think the convention started June 15th I
go down to Mar Lago that morning
Saturday morning and I&amp;#39;m talking to him
for the first time because the media
always ask me I was like one of the
rumored shortless candidates I kept on
getting these questions from reporters
have you ever been have you ever had
this conversation with Trump and the
honest answer was no well Saturday
morning that changed because I go down
there and he&amp;#39;s like what you know what
do you think why why why should I choose
you um why should I not choose these
other guys like we just had
was in the running you know I don&amp;#39;t
really know actually I I really don&amp;#39;t
know come on man look I I I I I think I
think that there were a couple of
senators that were being considered a
couple of Governors a couple of former
cabinet secretaries but you don&amp;#39;t really
know because when Donald Trump sat me
down I mean he talked about 10 different
people that he was thinking about naming
and this was two days before he made the
selection so he&amp;#39;s playing like a little
like let&amp;#39;s see how JD thinks game yeah I
think so and you know he he told me that
the he was talking to the gardener at
Mar about who the who the Vice
Presidential nominee should be and
that&amp;#39;s one of I think Trump&amp;#39;s sort of
political Geniuses is he talks to
everybody about everything and I was
like well what the what the Garder at
Margo have to say about this
conversation because this really
directly in impacts my life and you know
he he basically said well I think I&amp;#39;m
probably going to pick you but I don&amp;#39;t
know and I&amp;#39;m not ready to make a
decision and then he looks at one of his
staff members who&amp;#39;s in the room he&amp;#39;s
like actually wouldn&amp;#39;t it really set the
world a blaze if we just made the
decision today and so why don&amp;#39;t you come
up with me and we&amp;#39;ll just do the
announcement in Butler Pennsylvania well
and and I said and of course not knowing
at the time what was going to happen I
was like absolutely let&amp;#39;s get this over
with because I&amp;#39;m sick of not knowing
let&amp;#39;s just get this thing over with and
then he&amp;#39;s like ah no I&amp;#39;m not going to
I&amp;#39;m not going to do it up there we need
to prepare for it better so look I&amp;#39;m not
saying it&amp;#39;s going to be you but I&amp;#39;m
thinking very seriously about it have
fun we&amp;#39;ll see after Butler PA and then
of course I go back to home to Ohio oh
boy he gets shot you know the initial
reaction is I actually thought they had
killed him because when you first see
the video he grabs his ear and then he
goes down and I&amp;#39;m like oh my God they
just killed him and I was so I mean
first I was so pissed but then I go into
like fight ORF flight mode with my kids
I&amp;#39;m like you know all right kids you
know we were at a we were at a mini golf
place in Cincinnati Ohio I grab my kids
up throw them in the car go home and
load all my guns and basically stand
like a centry in our front door oh
and that was my that was sort of my
action to it anyway I really didn&amp;#39;t know
it was going to happen until Monday
morning I didn&amp;#39;t know who else was being
selected I think it was all the names
that people sort of see out there right
all good guys like nobody I have any any
personal animosity towards but obviously
you know here we are how much did you
study the story of the Assassin the
attempted assassin how much have you
paid attention to you know what Crooks
or cooks or whatever the guy&amp;#39;s name is
in Pennsylvania I mean I&amp;#39;ve read a fair
amount about it and it&amp;#39;s pretty bizarre
it&amp;#39;s very bizarre it&amp;#39;s bizarre they
haven&amp;#39;t been able to get into his phone
well they got they got into his phone um
didn&amp;#39;t they have they I I I thought
they&amp;#39;ve I thought they said they did
maybe you know better than me well maybe
they got into his phone but they
couldn&amp;#39;t access his encrypted messages
or something I I I thought there was
some deal where they they haven&amp;#39;t really
gotten his communication yet yeah I
maybe haven&amp;#39;t read it as closely as you
have so don&amp;#39;t take that as gospel
probably you have access to more
information but maybe you can&amp;#39;t talk
about it no TR trust me there&amp;#39;s nothing
about this that I have access in
information I can&amp;#39;t talk about well
there was a lot of weird stuff to it one
of them is that his uh where he lived
was professionally scrubbed so they got
there there was no silverware there&amp;#39;s no
silverware place scrubbed right yeah
there&amp;#39;s nothing there&amp;#39;s no no DNA no
hard drives no nothing and how do you
get that close I mean you know do you
shoot guns yeah okay so I&amp;#39;m a pretty
good shot I served in the ring Corps for
four years uh an AR-15 from 140 yards
away
is a shot even without a scope he didn&amp;#39;t
have a scope right I don&amp;#39;t believe he
had a scope without without a scope I&amp;#39;ve
shot an I&amp;#39;ve shot a M16 many times and
an AR15 without a scope there is no it
is shocking that he&amp;#39;s alive it really it
really is I I mean I you know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a
person of Faith but I I think it&amp;#39;s a
genuine miracle that that guy didn&amp;#39;t
kill him but how did he get so close
there&amp;#39;s a lot of really big questions he
was walking around the area with a
rangefinder
before the event and people were yelling
and saying this got a gun he&amp;#39;s on the
roof yeah you know there was that crazy
I think it was a BBC reporter somebody
with an English accent who did the
report on the ground with the guy you
know he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s like got a Maga hat on
and a Bud Light he&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re probably not
a Bud Light he&amp;#39;s got some beer and he&amp;#39;s
talking to this guy who saw Crooks get
on the roof and he&amp;#39;s yelling at him it&amp;#39;s
an amazing clip he&amp;#39;s yelling at him like
Hey he&amp;#39;s yelling at police officers
saying hey this guy&amp;#39;s on the roof go and
get him and nobody responded to it and
it&amp;#39;s the whole thing is very fishy to me
and I hope that we win and then get to
the bottom of it cuz I think somebody
clearly screwed up not it doesn&amp;#39;t seem
like just screwed up like the the excuse
that the lady from the Secret Service
had that they couldn&amp;#39;t put snipers on
the roof cuz the roof was
sloped like all of it is bananas the
whole that&amp;#39;s ridiculous that&amp;#39;s
ridiculous and the the miracle is Trump
turns his head at the last second at the
very last second he turns his head to
look at the chart and the bullet just
grazes his ear that&amp;#39;s right he&amp;#39;s got a
people keep there&amp;#39;s this stupid
conspiracy out there he&amp;#39;s got a mark on
his ear I saw it he has a mark on his
ear and people like why isn&amp;#39;t there a
hole in his ear because it&amp;#39;s just the
edge of the skin got hit that&amp;#39;s all it
was that&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s the luckiest of
luckiest shots ever for him
unfortunately not for the people that
were behind him cuz a couple of people
got shot and for anybody that thinks
that that was staged you don&amp;#39;t
understand shooting there&amp;#39;s no way you
can graze someone&amp;#39;s ear from 120 y you
can hit them Center Mass you&amp;#39;re not
going to be able to graze their ear you
could kill them easily accidentally if
you were faking something like that well
we&amp;#39;ve all seen the graphics right of him
turning his head and if he hadn&amp;#39;t turned
his head that it would have went right
through his brain and there was another
one that went to the left side of him
right that barely that barely missed him
yeah that barely missed him and then
instantly that guy is dead and then they
take a hold of his body he&amp;#39;s cremated 10
days
later there&amp;#39;s no press conference
there&amp;#39;s no toxicology report no one
talks about it on the news right and
when there&amp;#39;s a school shooter we usually
have the person&amp;#39;s Manifesto out there a
day or two later we know nothing about
the motive here which I think is the
craziest thing you know I&amp;#39;m obviously
he&amp;#39;s motivated because he hates Donald
Trump but you don&amp;#39;t know anything about
the secondary motive I man it is weird
it is really we don&amp;#39;t get a Manifesto is
when they&amp;#39;re trans when they&amp;#39;re trans
they hide those manifestos the N that
that the Nashville shooter man that was
crazy have you read any of it I&amp;#39;ve read
some of it and pretty wild it&amp;#39;s pretty
wild and yeah I mean that guy and they
decide that&amp;#39;s bad for the cause so they
decided and they they decided to
suppress it but no the Nashville shooter
I mean just while we&amp;#39;re on the topic
went in and murdered a bunch of children
at a Christian school because he or she
like whatever was motivated by some very
radical trans IDE ology and that is
something we should talk more about as a
country 100% And they didn&amp;#39;t want if if
there&amp;#39;s any other ideology that led
someone to mass murder you would examine
that ideology very carefully it was some
sort of radical religion people would be
like very concerned about that radical
religion that&amp;#39;s right and it is it&amp;#39;s
radical religion of War exactly what it
is it&amp;#39;s this weird idea that you are so
virtuous and so correct you&amp;#39;re allowed
to commit violence against these other
people because they&amp;#39;re the oppressors
even though they&amp;#39;re children well you
know these these signs that are in super
woke neighborhoods I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s
plenty of them in Austin like in this
house we believe science is real no
person is you know what I&amp;#39;m talking
about okay so I don&amp;#39;t know your
religious background but like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a
convert to Catholicism it&amp;#39;s like was
raised Christian became an atheist came
back to Christianity got baptized
Catholic like five or six years ago um
and what is so interesting about this in
this house we believe is it&amp;#39;s so similar
to the Creed that you declare every day
at a Catholic mass right we believe in
one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten
Son of God and there&amp;#39;s almost a similar
Cadence between the the Christian Creed
and what these these guys are doing with
this hyper woke stuff and then there&amp;#39;s
the rallies and then there&amp;#39;s of course
the various rituals and it absolutely is
a religious Faith there was this really
interesting post that was um you know I
forget exactly who wrote it but the
title was gay rights
as what was it um it was like gay rights
as religious rights but the second
Rights was r i
Tes and it was a guy who was like a pro
gay rights guy but sort of made the
observation that when you get into the
really radical trans stuff you actually
start to notice the similarities between
a practiced religious faith and what
these guys are doing yeah and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
very interesting I actually met earlier
with a friend who lives in Austin who&amp;#39;s
like a you know kind of a gay Reagan
Democrat and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s very very
interesting guy is is a fascinating guy
he&amp;#39;s one of the smartest political
philosophers I think how do you be a gay
Reagan Democrat I you know I I don&amp;#39;t
know um it&amp;#39;s just kind ofan Democrat I
mean he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s basically like now what
you would call a trump Republican but
he&amp;#39;s a political philosopher and he
writes about economics right that&amp;#39;s sort
of how I got connected to him I had no
idea he was gay when I first met him but
you know he I I&amp;#39;ll never forget he sent
me something like six or so years ago
and it was Elizabeth Warren when she was
running for president and she was like
we stand for all non-binary to Spirit
and all of the all of the like lgbti
plus she was talking about all the plus
and she was cying it and he sent me this
this text message with this Elizabeth
Warren tweet and he&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t know
what the hell to Spirit is we just
wanted to be left the hell
alone and I I think that frankly I
wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if me and Trump
won just the normal gay guy vote because
again they just wanted to be left the
hell alone and now you have all this
crazy stuff on top of it that they&amp;#39;re
like well no no no we didn&amp;#39;t we we
didn&amp;#39;t want to give pharmaceutical
products to 9-year-olds who are
transitioning their genders we just
wanted to be left the hell alone well a
lot of gay guys feel like the whole
movement is homophobic which is ironic
cuz they think there they think that
there&amp;#39;s people think there&amp;#39;s something
wrong with being gay so what you really
are is a girl yes and they think that a
lot of this is being given these
thoughts are being given to gay kids
these kids would just grow up to be gay
men and instead you&amp;#39;re getting them to
convert their gender it&amp;#39;s pharmaceutical
conversion therapy right and it&amp;#39;s
profitable which is terrifying it&amp;#39;s
terrifying once corporations once
pharmaceutical corporations have uh they
they have a pattern in a history of
profiting off of things they want to
keep profiting off of it they don&amp;#39;t want
to just stop and so right now this has
become a profitable Venture that scaled
if you go look back from like 2007 to
2024 there&amp;#39;s way more of these air
quotes gender affirming Care Centers and
they&amp;#39;re profitable well and this used to
be something that the old left right the
criticism that was made of American
Healthcare which I always thought made
some sense as a conservative guy is that
when you have the profit motive
influencing government policy around
Healthcare then yeah okay sometimes the
profit motive can be a good thing like
we&amp;#39;re going to develop life-saving
cancer drugs we want that to happen
right and I&amp;#39;m with people making a big
profit for that but then sometimes
they&amp;#39;ll try to manipulate government
policy to make their own drugs more
profitable not because it&amp;#39;s good for
health but because these people just
naturally like most people want to make
some money yeah and that conversation
has totally disappeared like I got into
a big argument and you know this person
you can read about the New York Times
later disavowed our friendship and
leaked our text messages to the New York
Times but the breaking point was I came
out against this gender transition for
minors when I was running for the Senate
a few years ago and she&amp;#39;s a transgender
individual and she kind of flipped out
on me and I I I the thing that I never
understood CU she&amp;#39;s like very much an
old school leftist is are you not at all
a little bit worried about how rich
people are getting by prescribing
experimental Therapeutics to 9 10
12-year-old kids like this used to be
something that the American left would
have gone crazy about and now the PE the
only people who are raising concerns
about it are conservative Republicans
but we should be concerned when because
it&amp;#39;s not just like the lobbying and the
influence I mean there there&amp;#39;s something
called the diagnostic statistical manual
it&amp;#39;s sort of the the manual of
psychiatric disorders and I think that
we&amp;#39;re on the DSM 5 as it&amp;#39;s called which
is the fifth edition of this manual you
have drug companies that are making
money that are lobbying to have you know
child dysphoria
put into our psychiatric manuals because
then psychiatrists will treat that
condition and then those pharmaceutical
companies will get rich from it somebody
should be interrogating whether the
political incentives of our country
actually align with the financial
incentives of the pharmaceutical
industry because often times the answer
is going to be no but nobody&amp;#39;s asking
that question well we&amp;#39;ve always known
that children are very easily influenced
and that children shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed
to make life-changing decisions when
they&amp;#39;re very young that&amp;#39;s why they can&amp;#39;t
get tattooed absolutely we&amp;#39;ve always
known that and then all of a sudden
because of gender that&amp;#39;s abandoned we&amp;#39;ve
completely changed the way we think that
children oh they just know I&amp;#39;ve had
mind-numbing conversations with people
who believe that and it all falls apart
if you just keep asking questions just
ask them to Define how can you know this
what about the development of the
frontal loob what about this
understanding that children have never
been able to make life-changing
decisions you don&amp;#39;t allow them to drink
alcohol you don&amp;#39;t allow them to get
tattooed they can&amp;#39;t join the military
when they&amp;#39;re 10 like there there&amp;#39;s a lot
of you can&amp;#39;t do when you&amp;#39;re a
little kid why are you letting them just
change their gender what does this even
mean and then the New York Times thing
that comes out where it shows that they
had a whole study about these puberty
blockers that showed that they do not
help the children&amp;#39;s mental health and
that they probably have a lot of
horrific side effects and so they
decided not to release they de not to
publish that right which shows you the
corruption of science is that we&amp;#39;re
actually not publishing studies that
suggest the gender transition craziness
has reached the boiling boiling point I
mean you know you have you&amp;#39;ve had you
you have kids I have a four-year-old and
a 2-year-old every single day my
four-year-old or 2-year-old will come to
me and say something that is batshit
insane because they&amp;#39;re four and two like
my four-year-old will come and say Daddy
I&amp;#39;m a dinosaur right I&amp;#39;m going to take
him to like the dinosaur transition
clinic and put scales on them and the
thing is this czy ing them and some
parents it&amp;#39;s just the I&amp;#39;m just going to
say it even though it sounds gross they
want their kid to be a part of the lgbtq
thing because it looks like a flag of
virtue that they can post in their front
long oh look we have a queer child like
oh you&amp;#39;re amazing there&amp;#39;s a weird thing
about it with some of these nutty
parents where you could imagine them in
there there has to be some reason why
this enormous percentage of Hollywood
kids are trans like how many celebrities
have trans kids it&amp;#39;s new it&amp;#39;s not a
thing that was going on just a few it
was rare in the past right it becomes a
social signifier for a lot of parents
and we have to be honest about that fact
and if you look at you know look at
where the gender craziness is the most
common it&amp;#39;s most common among upper
middle class to lower middle class white
progressives now you could believe okay
that there&amp;#39;s just like something genetic
going on in the mind of a wealthy white
Progressive or you could believe that
this is a cultural Trend that we should
be questioning a lot more than we are
right now and
unfortunately I mean here&amp;#39;s one thing
that I really worry about is
okay think about the incentives people
are very good at rationalizing things if
you are a you know middle class or upper
middle class white parent and the only
thing that you care about is whether
your child goes into Harvard or Yale
like obviously that pathway has become a
lot harder for a lot of upper middle
class kids but the one way that those
people can participate in the Dei
bureaucracy in this country is to be
trans and is there a dynamic that&amp;#39;s
going on where if you become trans that
is the way to reject your white
privilege right that&amp;#39;s the social
signifier the only one that&amp;#39;s available
in the hyper woke mindset is if you
become gender non-binary nonbinary is
the best one because you don&amp;#39;t even have
to do anything you just say I&amp;#39;m not I
could say I&amp;#39;m non-binary and like you
don&amp;#39;t have to do anything but all of a
sudden you&amp;#39;re a part of the group yeah
well that&amp;#39;s right and and again I I
think it&amp;#39;s important to sort of you know
most people are not saying oh I&amp;#39;m white
privileged how do I become part of the
privilege set but it&amp;#39;s these weird ways
in which these ideas creep in to the
mind to to the mainstream and people are
very good at rationalizing these things
and so what I think 20 30 years ago even
among very well-to-do white progressives
like an 11-year-old says I think
11-year-old boy says I think that I&amp;#39;m a
girl most of the time we would have said
oh that&amp;#39;s ridiculous and crazy and you
know haaha and come back to me in a
couple of days now I think there is this
massive incentive to try to say oh my
God is does that mean that my kid is
trans and I also think it&amp;#39;s to your
point very warping on the minds of young
kids because what they&amp;#39;re now doing is
taking normal adolescent curiosity and
normal adolescent discomfort like I
don&amp;#39;t know a single person who went from
the ages of 10 to 15 who didn&amp;#39;t say oh
like sometimes I had some you know weird
ideas or I dressed weird for a couple of
years or something right it&amp;#39;s a
confusing phase for most Americans we
take that normal adolescent confusion
confusion and then we try to medicalize
it and nobody&amp;#39;s saying oh when we do
medicalize it by the way a lot of
pharmaceutical companies get very rich
off of it not only very rich but then
the child is sterilized yes I mean this
is for a lot of these kids they&amp;#39;ll never
be able to have children ever again if
they change their mind if they one day
decide oh I I was just going through a
confusing time in my life but now I&amp;#39;ve
ruined my voice with hormones my o
ovaries are destroyed you know I had my
testicles removed like the whole thing
is crazy so this is where I had the real
Breaking Point with a friend that I
mentioned earlier is she made this argum
argument that puberty blockers are fully
reversible that&amp;#39;s crazy and IID actually
never heard that I me this is a few
years ago I&amp;#39;d never heard that argument
before and so I actually went and looked
at it and looked at the data on this the
idea that if you give puberty delaying
puberty blockers whatever you&amp;#39;re going
to call them to kids who are 11 12 13
that that&amp;#39;s fully reversible that is
completely and preposterously insane now
even the most radical Advocates of trans
Healthcare do not say that right because
look you have sexual dysfunction you
have to your point you know hair and
weird places that won&amp;#39;t go away you have
voice changes that won&amp;#39;t go away we are
experimenting on tens of thousands of
American children we&amp;#39;re making them
miserable it&amp;#39;s not having any long-term
health benefit it&amp;#39;s making a lot of
pharmaceutical companies rich and it&amp;#39;s
conservative Republicans are the only
ones saying ah maybe this is a little
crazy maybe we should stop well it just
shows you how a lot of this you know if
you can call it a mind virus or whatever
it is it it does make people behave
religiously yes so it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re
ignoring all of these signs because it
doesn&amp;#39;t line up with this ideology that
they subscribed to that&amp;#39;s right like you
you have to support trans kids like okay
what are you even saying how is this a
new thing so pervasive how is it
everywhere and how are you letting them
compete with girls in school this is th
that one drives me bananas when you have
biolog iCal males all they have to do is
they don&amp;#39;t even have requirements in
some schools you don&amp;#39;t have to be taking
hormones you can just identify and you
can compete as a girl and of course that
causes injury to the young girls of
course and again this gives me faith in
the wisdom of the American people
because if you see how radically the
Democrats leaned into this stuff four
years ago and how much you know KLA
Harris is running away from it today
most Americans they don&amp;#39;t really care
who you sleep with they&amp;#39;re pretty
open-minded about most lifestyle choices
but when you talk about having a
biological male compete with their
teenage girl in competitive Sports
Americans are saying no no no no this is
crazy you&amp;#39;re causing injury to my kids
we have to stop this not only that it
like ruins chances of getting
scholarships if you were the number one
player and then all of a sudden some guy
comes along who wears lipstick now he&amp;#39;s
the number one girl on the team like
what are you talking about yeah yeah
there was a recent pool tournament in
England it&amp;#39;s a women&amp;#39;s pool tournament
and in the semifinals two guys are
playing each other yeah well and it
looks when you see them in the actual
you know swimming pool competing it
looks like the biological males are
running at 1.5x speed and everybody else
is running at normal speed right this is
just clearly different and you to your
point about it destroys opportunities
for scholarships I mean go back to the
original reason why we wanted girls
Sports why we have Title 9 in the United
States of America to begin with like we
recognized the competitive sports like
what does it teach right it teaches you
how to participate on a team it teaches
you to recognize your own weaknesses and
the strengths of your teammates and vice
versa right like I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m the father of
a 2-year-old daughter I want my daughter
to learn these important life skills I
don&amp;#39;t want her going into athletic
competitions where I&amp;#39;m terrified she&amp;#39;s
going to get bludgeon to death because
we&amp;#39;re allowing a 6&amp;#39;1 male to compete
with her in sports where you should not
have biological males competing with
biological females not only that but
they get to change with them in the
locker rooms that&amp;#39;s where it gets like
there was one in Canada where a
50-year-old man identified as a teenage
girl he was a professor do you know
about this guy I haven&amp;#39;t heard about
this he was he was changing he was in a
swim meet with teenage girls yeah and
he&amp;#39;s changing in the same locker room as
them and then it&amp;#39;s crazy the problem
with that is people there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a
psychological condition called autog
gyil and autog feel is where men are
sexually aroused by the idea of dressing
and behaving like a woman but they&amp;#39;re
heterosexual now all of a sudden these
people with this known psychiatric
disorder are allowed to just identify as
a woman and you&amp;#39;re a bigot if you don&amp;#39;t
let them change in the women&amp;#39;s and
you&amp;#39;re expected to empower them at the
expense of young women who are very
often much more vulnerable for obvious
reasons than young men and it reminds me
of so the very first Congressional
Delegation trip that I ever took was to
Paris I think it was to to Paris and
it&amp;#39;s part of the Paris Air Show and Ohio
has all these you know Aviation
interests and anyway long story short I
was talking to a very conservative woman
at the Paris Air Show who was from
Mississippi and she was probably
6570 and it was really interesting
because I was just like you know how do
how do you find the city she had never
been to Paris before and I&amp;#39;m just you
know interested in people so I was
asking her and she said you know what&amp;#39;s
really interesting is I just feel like
Paris I would think of as very liberal
but I actually think Paris is more
conservative than some of the big cities
in the United States and I said oh he
tell me more about this and this woman
doesn&amp;#39;t know me very well and she&amp;#39;s
clearly kind of embarrassed to tell me
but she walks through she says well I
just don&amp;#39;t see any people like when
you&amp;#39;re in Paris the girls are girls and
the boys are boys and that&amp;#39;s true in
Paris and that&amp;#39;s not necessarily true in
some of our big cities and then and then
she says she she says she says Senator
Vance I&amp;#39;m embarrassed to tell you this
but when I was in New York City recently
I saw a grown man who was walking around
in a miniskirt and then she gets very
quiet and she said Cinder fans I could
see his
balls he probably wanted you to see his
balls and you realize oh my God this is
not this is not empowerment this is not
respecting lifestyle choices we&amp;#39;re
letting a grown man walk around in a
miniskirt in broad daylight like what
are you talk about I feel like you
should be allowed to wear a Min skirt if
a girl can wear a mini skirt you can
wear a mini skirt that&amp;#39;s not what
bothers me but what me I have to see
your balls to flash people in broad
daylight in New York City pervert that&amp;#39;s
what you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re a pervert and I
want I want all of us to say whatever
your political persuasion just say no
that&amp;#39;s weird you&amp;#39;re not allowed to walk
down the street and Flash children in
the middle of the world&amp;#39;s or the
America&amp;#39;s biggest city and it reminds me
you know Emanuel mccrone who&amp;#39;s the the
leader of France made this observation
about you know somebody asked him why
hasn&amp;#39;t all the transgender stuff made
its way into France and Emanuel mcon
says well in France we have two genders
and that&amp;#39;s
plenty I kind of wish that was the
attitude that we had in the United
States of America well have you ever
heard mark andreon break down um that
the why woke is like a cult he does it
he&amp;#39;s a brilliant guy he&amp;#39;s a very he&amp;#39;s a
very good friend yeah I I&amp;#39;ve heard this
yeah it&amp;#39;s brilliant and he talks about
how you can be excommunicated from the
cult if you don&amp;#39;t follow the doctrine
you have to follow religiously to the
letter that&amp;#39;s where all this stuff like
if you&amp;#39;re allowing guys to just have
their balls hanging out walking on the
street because it&amp;#39;s empowering yeah and
because like you&amp;#39;re being inclusive like
well no you&amp;#39;re empowering perverts yeah
it&amp;#39;s a cult and it&amp;#39;s a religion but with
one big difference and I think this is
you know actually this this observation
is probably one of the things that led
me back to my own faith but I I I sort
of just a fundamental background belief
I have about humanity is you know we are
the hardware right we&amp;#39;re biological
organisms we&amp;#39;re the hardware and the
software is the ideas that we have in
our head
and certain software promotes human
flourishing and certain software
destroys human flourishing and I think
that the the good kind of ideas tend to
promote human flourishing what is what
you know most world
religions have but the woke stuff
doesn&amp;#39;t have is forgiveness and
Redemption yes right it has the
excommunication part but it doesn&amp;#39;t have
the forgiveness and Redemption Part most
people recognize that even if you
violate some fundamental moral value I
have if you apologize and try to be a
good person we&amp;#39;re going to be forgiving
we want people to be able to live
together there is this weird thing with
the woke stuff where when and you see
this and I feel bad when like comedians
in particular do it I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve seen
this but when anybody does this where
they&amp;#39;ll go and say well I&amp;#39;m really sorry
they&amp;#39;ll sort of prostrate themselves
when they make an offensive joke or they
do something they&amp;#39;re not supposed to do
and they expect Redemption but no no no
they don&amp;#39;t get forgiveness what they get
is you need to do even more of what
you&amp;#39;ve already done it becomes this
self-defeating self- flatulating cycle
and I think that&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s most
destructive about this is you can&amp;#39;t be
friends with people if you think they&amp;#39;re
only you know they&amp;#39;re only ever wrong
they can only ever wrong you and and
they if they apologize your respons is
not to say oh okay I accept your apology
if your response is to say no I want you
to apologize even more and even harder
that destroys human civilization that&amp;#39;s
it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an interesting observation
right because it really does behave like
a religion but it&amp;#39;s a religion without
like a good Doctrine yes it&amp;#39;s a religion
that hasn&amp;#39;t been thought out by wise
people and where they haven&amp;#39;t come up
with these different like like the Ten
Commandments or different Pathways to
correct to forgiveness there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
nothing so it&amp;#39;s a this thing that
behaves like a religion but it&amp;#39;s not
really well thought out and it&amp;#39;s very
loic and it also combines pharmaceutical
drug companies and all there&amp;#39;s a lot of
other weird that&amp;#39;s attached to this
religion yes that you kind of need like
if if if if you&amp;#39;re going to do this
whole woke thing and like go guns of
Blazing you&amp;#39;re going to have to get
drugs involved like you&amp;#39;re going to have
to they&amp;#39;re going to have to do hormone
blockers it&amp;#39;s like it doesn&amp;#39;t just
happen on its own and that somehow or
another is natural to them like this is
how you be your your true self like your
true self is you you add hormones that
aren&amp;#39;t supposed to be in your body
that&amp;#39;s your true self like how do you
know and and it&amp;#39;s irreversible are we
 sure this is yeah and oh by the
way instead of your true self being
maybe I should be skeptical of some of
the crap that I&amp;#39;m putting into my body I
should lean into the idea that I should
put more foreign things into the human
body that that&amp;#39;s what to me is so
fascinating about it is the true self
like you know I think all of us that&amp;#39;s
sort of part of the human Journey For
Truth truth we&amp;#39;re all asking who is you
know who are we what is our true self
and maybe we should be asking oursel
this is sort of more of a Bobby Kennedy
point but why are we putting all this
weird crap into our food into our water
maybe we should be a little bit more
skeptical like my body as a temple
rather than I&amp;#39;m going to welcome even
more pharmaceutical intervention into
the human body it&amp;#39;s very interesting how
some religions view the body as a temple
and some religions almost invite the
pollution I think the woke say is
inviting the pollution well they&amp;#39;re also
inviting see what one of the weirdest
things is if you are on the wrong side
of their ideology like if you&amp;#39;re aligned
with Trump like RFK Jr is now all a
sudden I&amp;#39;ve seen like people on the left
that are trying to dismiss a lot of the
things that he says about additives and
food about atrazine fluoride in the wall
all these different things because now
they&amp;#39;re connecting not having toxins in
your food with a right-wing idea it&amp;#39;s
crazy it&amp;#39;s mindblowing it&amp;#39;s so bananas
like even being healthy Fitness Fitness
they&amp;#39;re connecting Fitness with a
right-wing idea like yeah well and it it
raises one of my sort of core political
beliefs is that our politics is focused
on fake and distractions to
distract us from the real stuff right
and so if I&amp;#39;m looking at the
environmental movement in the United
States of America and I don&amp;#39;t even have
like strong views on the you know what
the carbon footprint ultimately does I&amp;#39;m
sort of skeptical of the experts here
but I&amp;#39;m also skeptical of you know the
other side I I just don&amp;#39;t really know
what I think about this I think it&amp;#39;s
insane to try to eliminate fossil fuels
that&amp;#39;s kind of a belief that I have but
it&amp;#39;s interesting that the environmental
movement in America the only thing that
it talks about is the carbon footprint
and it never talks about like oh why do
we have the highest rates of obesity in
the world right now right why why is it
that American Kids spend less time
outdoors in nature than they ever have
in the history of our 250 years
civilization there&amp;#39;s this weird way in
which we get distracted by the fake
stuff instead of focusing on the real
stuff and I think there is a really very
important environmental conversation to
be had it was interesting when one of
the first things that happened when I
was a Senator is you had this terrible
train derailment in East Palestine Ohio
got a lot of headlines and it was a
mistake at the time that wasn&amp;#39;t obvious
they basically set off a few of the
chemical cars which I mean if you see
the images it looks like a nuclear bomb
went off in East Palestine Ohio but it&amp;#39;s
putting Vinyl chloride and all these
other pollutants into the water into the
air into the soil and it was amazing the
environmental movement almost could not
have cared less about a chemical
explosion in rural Ohio that is
potentially poisoning thousands of
people but they were really really
concerned about the carbon footprint of
those same people I I I I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sick
of the distraction I think we should
focus on the real stuff and
unfortunately it&amp;#39;s true of the
environmental policy but it&amp;#39;s true of a
lot of other stuff we just don&amp;#39;t talk
about the real thing the carbon
footprint think is very concerning to me
because I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m seeing this concept that
being pushed out of having an app that
monitors your carbon footprint and
limiting the amount of travel you can do
and limiting the amount thing I know
where that&amp;#39;s going to go yeah just
control it&amp;#39;s just controlling contr and
if you can do that then you can get away
with a lot of things you can get a lot
away with a lot of policy you get away
with a lot of decisions that are made
that people wouldn&amp;#39;t agree with because
you&amp;#39;re going to limit so many things
about their life they&amp;#39;re going to become
accustomed to being governed in that way
it just it&amp;#39;s disturbing to me that
there&amp;#39;s also profit that&amp;#39;s being made
off the green movement there&amp;#39;s a lot of
people like Bill Gates who have like
making a lot of money off of these
environmentally conscious things $50
million Comm Harris by the way although
is fake food that fake meat
which is not good for anybody me out man
you read about fake meat folks read
about how they&amp;#39;re making this and I&amp;#39;m
not talking about 3D printed meat which
is a very different thing which seems to
be at least more consumable but like the
plant-based meat stuff that&amp;#39;s garbage
that stuff is garbage so highly
processed garbage if you want to eat
vegetables and beat vegetarian eat
Indian food okay like they make really
delicious Indian am they make very good
they make the best vegetarian food but
it tastes good and it&amp;#39;s actually
vegetables it&amp;#39;s not this crazy fake
cheeseburger thing that you have like no
that&amp;#39;s right stop eating that when we
when I first started dating my wife I
just had no idea like what vegetarians
ate right I&amp;#39;m like a meat and potatoes
um guy from Ohio and I wanted to make
her dinner and I wanted to really
impress her cuz I was like madly in love
with her and did you cook beef no the
meal that I the meal that I made her I&amp;#39;m
not proud of this but I&amp;#39;ll tell you was
you know Crescent are those like
Pillsbury yeast rolls so I rolled out a
flat thing of crescent rolls I put raw
broccoli on top of it I sprinkled ranch
dressing and I stuck it in the oven for
45 minutes and it was disgusting and
that was my vegetarian pizza that I made
wow did you follow a recipe no you just
like decided it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like cream I
know she she ate you know Dairy it&amp;#39;s
it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s broccoli and it&amp;#39;s bread right
that&amp;#39;s what vegetarians eat so yeah I I
think that to your point vegetarian food
can actually be quite good yes I don&amp;#39;t
you know I still I still like I&amp;#39;m kind
of one of these people where if I don&amp;#39;t
have a piece of meat it&amp;#39;s not a complete
meal but if you&amp;#39;re going to eat
vegetarian eat paneer and rice and
delicious chickpeas do not eat this
disgusting fake meat I&amp;#39;m just very
skeptical when someone is promoting
things for either Global health or for
the environment and then I find out that
they have a ton of money invested in
companies that could fit those needs
it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a real problem this philanth
capitalism it&amp;#39;s very weird man we got to
look at the we have to look at the
financial incentives of this I mean so
one of the big things that me and
president Trump confront all the time is
the accusation that we&amp;#39;re somehow like
in bed with Russia which is like the the
dumbest thing in the world to me like I
don&amp;#39;t really care about Russia I just
don&amp;#39;t think we should have a nuclear war
like RIT large I&amp;#39;m very anti-nuclear War
sounds reasonable thank you appreciate
that and one of the things they never
interrogate is who is the biggest funer
of the green energy movement in Europe
it&amp;#39;s the Russians and why are the
Russians funding it&amp;#39;s not because they
care about climate change it&amp;#39;s because
they want the Germans and everybody else
to buy Russian natural gas and they
realize that if the Germans and French
close down all their coal and nuclear
factories Russia is going to have them
buy the balls how do they get the
Germans to
close oh
it&amp;#39;s m did mine did okay
okay see what&amp;#39;s
up one
of holy the Russians the Russians
are monitoring this
[Laughter]
conversation don&amp;#39;t know what happen
check check yeah oh I hear me now yeah I
hear me yeah okay got it yeah what what
no I&amp;#39;m out no it&amp;#39;s gone again Jamie huh
we&amp;#39;ll be right back oh I&amp;#39;m back yeah but
I don&amp;#39;t even know if I&amp;#39;m going to stay
back how I know if it keeps working well
I&amp;#39;m listening but I don&amp;#39;t know what what
happened okay should we shift or should
we just let&amp;#39;s try this and then we
can keep going just let me know if it
goes again and I&amp;#39;ll put my headphones on
if it goes again had a slight technical
problem ladies and gentlemen so where
were we talking
about Jam
button it must be I don&amp;#39;t know where it
is but your foot&amp;#39;s not touching it no
am I touching something no no no no okay
it&amp;#39;s
back it&amp;#39;s back Jamie Jamie you got to
replace this I keep saying that but now
you really
do we
good I hear it yeah yeah okay I&amp;#39;m not
going to move I&amp;#39;m not touching anything
all right we&amp;#39;re back what were we just
talking about well we were talking about
how you asked why why do the Germans
shut down their nuclear facilities and I
know you know it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re shutting down
coal they&amp;#39;re shutting down any of their
base power and leaning really into solar
and wind but again the the green energy
movement in Europe is heavily funded by
the Russians because the Russians want
to have because they produce so much
natural gas they want to have Europe buy
the balls so again how do they convince
them to shut down their nuclear power
plants well in the same way that Bill
Gates is convincing us to eat fake meat
is they fund all this stuff and they
make it about the environment well
that&amp;#39;s true but he&amp;#39;s trying to the
problem is you look at him and you go
hey how are you a health expert this is
look at you the funniest thing ever was
when Elon put showed a photo of Bill
Gates next to a photo of a pregnant man
emoji and he said if you want to lose a
boner real quick
and that&amp;#39;s a wild boy you imagine Elon
is funny as man he&amp;#39;s actually he&amp;#39;s
funny as getting dumped on by that
guy&amp;#39;s got to suck cuz you can&amp;#39;t even say
he&amp;#39;s a dumb ass right that&amp;#39;s right you
can say many things you can&amp;#39;t say he&amp;#39;s a
dumbass you get Dunked On by one of the
smartest guys alive but the point is
like Bill doesn&amp;#39;t look good he looks
terrible he&amp;#39;s aging way harder than
Trump like it doesn&amp;#39;t whatever you&amp;#39;re
doing don&amp;#39;t eat like that anymore like
go to an actual doctor like I don&amp;#39;t know
what you&amp;#39;re doing who&amp;#39;s telling you eat
your fake meat this is you look like
 so you can&amp;#39;t give advice this is
crazy you can&amp;#39;t give advice about health
you&amp;#39;re not a healthy person that&amp;#39;s right
you know well I did so there&amp;#39;s this
thing called the munic SEC Conference in
uh in Germany obviously it&amp;#39;s in Munich
it&amp;#39;s kind of like Davos but for National
Security and I went there and it was
like a big deal for me because I went in
there as the one skeptic in the entire
this like massive Euro complex KLA
Harris is there I went as the person
skeptical of continued escalation in
Ukraine because I think that what we&amp;#39;re
doing in Ukraine is insane and that we
should have a policy effectively of
promoting peace in the region and we we
walk in and one of the people that I&amp;#39;m
on this panel with is the leader of the
German green
party and you know she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s like 30
years old and she really really cares
about Russia Ukraine she&amp;#39;s like the
youngest person in the German government
and you realize you are like the exact
like you guys are literally Russian
influence like you&amp;#39;re accusing me of
wanting to do Russia&amp;#39;s bidding you&amp;#39;re
encouraging your own country from the
perch of government to shut down all
Basel load power and you&amp;#39;re not even
self-aware about how much of your own
propaganda is funded by the country
that&amp;#39;s benefiting from this the the lack
of ability to interrogate I mean Bill
Gates you know like maybe he&amp;#39;s a good
guy I&amp;#39;m highly skeptical I don&amp;#39;t know
him very well but he&amp;#39;s getting rich off
of all of this stuff that he&amp;#39;s
supporting in the name of health or in
the name of climate our inability to
just ask ourselves who&amp;#39;s getting rich
from this stuff maybe we should be
skeptical of the people getting rich
from this stuff is one of our big
failures as a political soci
it&amp;#39;s a sheep costume you put on a sheep
costume and you make a lot of money with
global Health you know and who doesn&amp;#39;t
want Global Health what a nice guy yeah
oh he&amp;#39;s like very philanthropic he&amp;#39;s
he&amp;#39;s spending all this money trying to
help poor people right and then you find
out like wait a minute how much money
did you make doing that yeah exactly you
made a $500 million doing that that&amp;#39;s
crazy it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very sneaky move but
he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a smart guy he&amp;#39;s in a lot of
very sneaky moves like the donating all
the money to the media companies which
is why they never criticize him right
he&amp;#39;s donated like 350 million dollars to
all these different companies that&amp;#39;s
right or you know this is I think one of
the reasons why we don&amp;#39;t have more
people asking questions about big Pharma
of is the entire National media think
about how many pharmaceutical
advertisements you watch when you watch
a football game yeah let&amp;#39;s get into this
because this is an interesting one so
one of the things that happened that
separated us from the rest of the world
other than New Zealand is in the 1990s
they allowed pharmaceutical drug
companies to advertise that&amp;#39;s right what
do you is that something that has to
stay that way is that something that
could be changed in with policy or is
the financial incentives of that too big
to move oh you could change it with
policy I don&amp;#39;t know that you do you
think that you would have enough support
to do something like that it&amp;#39;s
interesting question I I so I&amp;#39;ve been
critical of pharmaceutical advertising
for a long time uh my assumption is that
there are not enough people who would
like to do it to actually get it done
but you know I&amp;#39;ve never actually talked
to my colleagues about it so may maybe
it&amp;#39;s possible I bet if you ask the
American people you know I bet that&amp;#39;s
one of those things if you put it to a
national vote instead of Representatives
the problem with Representatives is
special interest groups special interest
groups lobbyists and the amount of money
yeah the the whole conduit of money into
politics is fundamentally broken I think
we have to fix that but I mean here okay
here&amp;#39;s the thing and I say this as a
Critic of pharmaceutical advertising
whenever I see a Pharma ad and I pretty
much only see them when I&amp;#39;m watching
football I&amp;#39;m always sh shocked that they
actually influence anybody right because
it&amp;#39;s like oh take this drug for
rheumatoid arthritis and you can have
all these positive experiences and it&amp;#39;s
like oh the side effects are uh you know
erectile dysfunction rashes on your face
suicid suicidal ideation tumors in your
brain and you&amp;#39;ll hate yourself and be
depressed so you&amp;#39;ll need this other drug
and I always wonder like you get so many
of these weird side effects in the
advertisements how how do they actually
work so I actually think that the real
corruption is not really that they like
persuade Americans I mean if you&amp;#39;re
going to take a drug you&amp;#39;re probably
going to take a drug based on
conversations with your doctor more than
a Pharm advertisement but they do
corrupt the media ecosystem because if
you&amp;#39;re getting all that money from the
Pharma companies then you&amp;#39;re not going
to launch investigations into some of
the things you should be launching
investigations into 100% and that&amp;#39;s why
it&amp;#39;s dangerous because it&amp;#39;s not like
these are completely innocent companies
and have never done anything wrong so if
you all of a sudden have them removed
from your list of people that you&amp;#39;re
investigating just because they
advertised they&amp;#39;ve essentially bribed
you that&amp;#39;s right they&amp;#39;ve bribed you and
you&amp;#39;re supposed to be the people that
distribute the actual news to the
American people and you&amp;#39;re compromised
so okay so let me tell you this this
story and this is okay this is purely
secondary so if you know somebody tries
to fact check it I heard this from a
friend but I heard it from a friend I I
trusted so he was a guy I knew and he
worked at the largest industry lobbying
Organization for the pharmaceutical
companies and I was in DC this is a long
time ago and I just kind of ran into
them and you know I care a lot about the
opioid problem uh my mom struggled with
opioids for a very long time she&amp;#39;s been
clean and sober for a while but I&amp;#39;m very
proud of you I love you mom I know
you&amp;#39;re watching this but Jan into this
guy in the street in DC and he&amp;#39;s he had
just quit his job for this
pharmaceutical lobbying organization or
he was talking about quitting and I was
like why he&amp;#39;s like man we just did
something that&amp;#39;s very dark and basically
what they had figured out is because
American Indian tribes Americans have
Tribal sovereignty and so they figured
out I guess that if they gave some
Native American tribe some fraction of a
fraction of a penny of the royalties
from the cell of opioids that they could
actually insulate themselves from
litigation around the prescription
opioid epidemic and I guess this guy was
just like thought it was so dirty that
he was like I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t work for
this organization anymore and I was like
holy that is some pretty dark stuff
so you guys are giving some Native
American tribe like pennies so that you
can insulate yourself from
pharmaceutical litigation I I&amp;#39;d be very
curious I should follow up on this to
see if that actually happened but again
just to be clear if the media tries to
fact check me this is what I heard from
friend Jamie fact check right now Jamie
I&amp;#39;m very curious if this actually
happened look it look into it because
but I I think it did happen because I
saw the look on this guy&amp;#39;s face and he
was like man this is some pretty dark
stuff that&amp;#39;s crazy
yeah but that&amp;#39;s how corporations behave
you know we were just the trigonometry
guys were on here yesterday and we were
talking about it that corporations
behave like Psychopaths like that&amp;#39;s
there&amp;#39;s a book about it it&amp;#39;s like they
they describe how this endless Pursuit
cut off again it really you know what it
is Jamie whenever I move the mic tell me
when it&amp;#39;s back you just hit it and it
made a noise it must be the cable
sorry oh this is it dude that got it oh
you got it this was Lo
try it now tell me
now I mean I heard that click I bet
that&amp;#39;s what it was is that it we&amp;#39;re good
okay what was that thing you want me to
check real quick sorry um pharmaceutical
companies
using um giving royalty streams to
Native American tribes to insulate
themselves from lawsuits anyway yeah
it&amp;#39;s very scary stuff well yeah it&amp;#39;s and
it&amp;#39;s this is like one of the things that
I think is genuinely different about and
I don&amp;#39;t want to get too too partisan
political here but about Donald Trump&amp;#39;s
Republican party is is I mean obviously
like there are corporations that were&amp;#39;re
more Pro certain businesses and we tend
to be more anti certain businesses like
for example big Tech I hate big Tech we
can get into that later but
fundamentally I think president Trump
has changed the mindset of the
Republican party to where it was like
instinctively always Pro corporate we&amp;#39;re
now sometimes willing to ask well is
this corporation&amp;#39;s interest and the
American interest like there was this
famous quote I believe from the
leadership of GM back in the 1950s that
General Motors interest is America&amp;#39;s
interest and I&amp;#39;m probably butchering the
quote but sort of paraphrased can
anybody really in 2024 say that Google&amp;#39;s
interest is America&amp;#39;s interest or apple
which employs thousands of slaves and
Chin Jen is Apple&amp;#39;s interest is
America&amp;#39;s interest like I I just don&amp;#39;t
that&amp;#39;s ridiculous and the fact that
we&amp;#39;re at least somewhat skeptical of
corporate power in the Republican party
I think is a very good trend for us it
is kind of weird that one one of the
wokest companies if you thought about
like woke companies and like super
Progressive and like on the right side
of everything Apple Apple&amp;#39;s like one of
the best ones and they have phones that
are made by slaves yeah like the the the
people definitionally yeah the people
are they put Nets around the building CU
so many of them were jumping to their
deaths yes instead of fixing the work
conditions they just go put up some Nets
yeah put up put up some Nets so that
people
the crazy thing is you still like all
these like Progressive people are using
these devices to talk about like
important social issues oh yeah well and
talking about distractions right the the
distraction like distraction politics
versus real politics if Apple says #blm
and gives a few million dollars to a
trans rights organization then the
entire political left ignores that
they&amp;#39;re profiting off of slave labor
it&amp;#39;s bizarre now why can&amp;#39;t Apple here it
is strange beds Native American tribes
Biga legitimacy of their Alliance
wow so it&amp;#39;s true 2019 my God this is
about exact you said it&amp;#39;s 2019 I was
going to say I think I saw that guy in
like 2018 it&amp;#39;s so gross it&amp;#39;s so gross
crazy man it&amp;#39;s so sick but it&amp;#39;s what
we&amp;#39;re talking about if you allow these
corporations look they have an
obligation to their shareholders they
have to make more money what&amp;#39;s the best
way to make more money not get sued
what&amp;#39;s the best way to not get sued for
sir I found a loophole he get some
 ader rid
psychopath been working 16 hours like I
got a plan against out of here and it
works it&amp;#39;s legal who I&amp;#39;m sorry like look
I get the imper imperative to make money
but the guy who thought that up is a
grade a sociopath I mean that person is
I don&amp;#39;t want them anywhere near my kids
you got to put guard rails up like you
have to have laws that&amp;#39;s why you can&amp;#39;t
have insider trading right like you have
have guard rails up don&amp;#39;t people go ham
and this is why look corporations want
to go make money they should make money
fine but my job is public and social
policy and what really pisses me off and
frankly what should piss off more
Republicans because you historically the
Republican party has been the mo more
Pro corporate party we should be saying
to the more that these corporations are
engaged in social policy in particular
left-wing social policy the more that we
should be saying ah I don&amp;#39;t know that I
want to give you everything that you
want which is of course what the
historical party did but I think is much
different in the last few years I&amp;#39;m just
scared that the tentacles of the
pharmaceutical industry are so deeply
entrenched in politics and in media that
you can&amp;#39;t just shake them off you can&amp;#39;t
just say hey you can&amp;#39;t advertise on TV
anymore or hey you no long longer have
exemption from responsibility from the
side effects of certain drugs because
the the that that whole thing they
pulled off with exemption of
pharmaceutical companies being
responsible for
injuries was crazy crazy because you
just empow these people that have lied
forever yeah it does still exist and it
still exists and that is totally insane
and I I mean you know I so I I I took I
took the vax and you know I haven&amp;#39;t been
boosted or anything but the the moment
where I really started to get redpilled
on the whole vaa thing was the sickest
that I have been in the last 15 years by
far was when I took the VAC
and I you know I&amp;#39;ve had Co at this point
five times I was in bed for 2 days my
heart was racing I was like the fact
that we&amp;#39;re not even allowed to talk
about that even you know I no no like
serious injury but but even the fact
that we&amp;#39;re not even allowed to talk
about the fact that I was as sick as
I&amp;#39;ve ever been for two days and the
worst covid experience I had was like a
sinus infection I&amp;#39;m not really willing
to trade that and you don&amp;#39;t even you
know everybody that I know a lot of
people I know they talk about the second
shot that they got of the vaccine was
really made them really really sick well
that&amp;#39;s a side effect and not a side
effect that we even talk about enough in
this country no it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s also again
we&amp;#39;re talking about companies that have
a long history of lying and being forced
to pay criminal fines and then we&amp;#39;re
giving them this exemption from being
responsible for any of the side effects
yeah and who do you think those big
Pharma companies donate to politically
in 2024
a big fat guess probably K
Harris by a significant margin well
particularly with RFK Jr being attached
to Trump sure RFK Jr comes a lot of you
know like there&amp;#39;s a lot there&amp;#39;s a lot
that you&amp;#39;re going to have to handle
there but that&amp;#39;s the question is like
is are they so entrenched that it&amp;#39;s
impossible to turn these things that
disturb us the fact that they have
exemption from any responsibility
because of the vaccine the fact that
they have the ability to advertise on
television can those things be removed
is that a possible thing I think it&amp;#39;s a
possible thing but because I haven&amp;#39;t
actually done the work to figure out how
many of my colleagues would sign on to
this I can&amp;#39;t say whether it&amp;#39;s like a
certain thing or a likely thing or just
something that we should be working on
when I I mean here here interesting
thought experiment if there was one
thing that we could do to rein in the
pharmaceutical companies like what would
it be would it be liability on the VAC
stuff would it be advertising in my
intuition is actually it might be the
advertising on the healthcare stuff
because that&amp;#39;s the way in which they
engulf the media into this whole scam
that would be great but the the vaccine
thing is important too because I will
look into it that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll
that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll say here because I
would need to talk to people to see if
this is even possible it&amp;#39;s a weird one
where you&amp;#39;re not even allowed to
question it you&amp;#39;re not allowed to
discuss it and that becomes very
religious just like all these other
things that we talked where you have
this this thing that everybody speaks
about in hush tones people know people
that have been vaccin injured and
particularly people on the left they&amp;#39;re
very reluctant to discuss it even
publicly yeah I know people who are
public people who have had serious
vaccine side effects who do not want
anyone to talk about it absolutely
they&amp;#39;re scared of being labeled an
antivaxer I have a c colleague who
doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about it but
worries that it&amp;#39;s like permanently
affected his sort of sense of balance
and dizziness in Vertigo and yeah it it
happens I&amp;#39;ve talked to a number of
people who think that they got vaccine
injured some of them are public about it
and some of them are not but here&amp;#39;s the
thing like I&amp;#39;m not even you&amp;#39;re probably
more anti- Pharma than I am like there
are certain things I&amp;#39;m pretty proa too I
think they make great drugs that help
people all sorts of conditions and
diabetes medication insulin I mean like
the Sickle Cell stuff that&amp;#39;s coming out
now we maybe have cured CLE cell disease
in Black Americans because of a gene
therapy the first I read about it a
couple weeks ago actually that the first
experimental therapy and it was hard for
the kid who took it but you had like an
11 or 12-year-old black American just
walk out of the hospital and he&amp;#39;s
probably cured of sickle cell disease
right that stuff is amazing but I
actually think that in some ways what we
should be encouraging these companies to
do is that right we want them to develop
the life-saving drugs we don&amp;#39;t want them
to get rich by shielding themselves from
liability
or or working with Native American
tribes so that they don&amp;#39;t get sued and I
actually think there maybe even is a
Harmony between those viewpoints because
if they had to get rich by developing
life-saving Therapeutics and that&amp;#39;s the
only way they could get rich then they&amp;#39;d
probably do more of that right 100% but
again that that&amp;#39;s where public policy
comes in and that&amp;#39;s where like my job is
to make sure that when the
pharmaceutical companies get rich they
get rich by curing diseases not by doing
like weird psychotic things with Native
American tribes and you can&amp;#39;t have this
argument that we need exemption from
responsibility because otherwise we&amp;#39;re
not going to be able to profit off of
these things like absolutely well that
means you&amp;#39;re making stuff that too many
people are getting sick from so they&amp;#39;re
 suing you that&amp;#39;s socialized
costs right it&amp;#39;s one of the biggest
problems with corporate America is
socialized costs but privatized profits
profits and what you really want is that
you want major American companies and
I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m a Believer in the market
economy you want them to absorb the
benefits but also the costs and that&amp;#39;s
often what doesn&amp;#39;t happen like for
example so I talked about this train
disaster in East Palestine and you know
the railroad companies hate me because I
kind of went on a crusade against them
afterwards and what I realized is think
of all the costs of that disaster think
of the health care costs the welfare
costs from people who lost their jobs
the declining home values in that
Community just all of the costs absorbed
by that community and the railroads are
paying slap on the hand fines and it
sort of occurred to me that the reason
they&amp;#39;re not more serious about these
train disasters is because they&amp;#39;re
privatizing their rewards but when a a
major train disaster happens who who
picks up the tab it&amp;#39;s the local
residents and it&amp;#39;s the American taxpayer
and that&amp;#39;s something that fundamentally
has to change yeah that has to change
and when you&amp;#39;re talking about the cost
from a place like East Palestine how
much can they clean that up like how
long does that stay toxic cuz it was
millions of gallons right wasn&amp;#39;t it some
what was the number of gallons gallons
but it was a lot and I hate to say the
answer your question how much how much
can they clean up the answer is I don&amp;#39;t
know and I actually this is one of my
biggest frustrations probably my single
biggest frustration uh over my time in
the Senate is when this happened a bunch
of the residents came to me it&amp;#39;s
actually very sweet and even kind of
patriotic but certainly self-sacrificing
where they said look no one knows what
the effect of this is going to be
15 years down the road right cuz cuz we
like we weren&amp;#39;t worried about okay a guy
drinks the water in East Palestine and
drops dead the water levels did not have
toxins at that level but the question
was what happens when you&amp;#39;re em bibbing
the stuff breathing it in drinking it at
low at Trace levels for 10 15 years like
do you have weird diseases down the road
hopefully not right I pray every day
that hopefully not but you can only
study that in the moment and so we
actually working with a a public health
epidemiologist in North Carolina and
some in Ohio we actually came up with a
plan like here&amp;#39;s what you would need to
do you&amp;#39;d collect samples in the first 6
months to a year after the disaster and
I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m talking about like
fingernail clippings things like that
you&amp;#39;d establish a baseline of toxins in
people&amp;#39;s blood and then 5 years later 10
years later you try to figure out what
the toxins were in people&amp;#39;s blood 5
years 10 years down the road and then
you&amp;#39;d ask yourself what weird diseases
if any are people starting to develop at
after 5 10 15 years right the long-term
health effects of this stuff and it was
in some ways a really interesting thing
to study because we had never had a
chemical disaster where we tried to
study the effects of years down the road
and of course how much would this cost
between 5 and 20 million doll over the
whole lifetime of the study we couldn&amp;#39;t
get Biden Harris we couldn&amp;#39;t even get
some of my colleagues in the United
States Senate to give a and it&amp;#39;s
really frustrating to me because the
time is now passed right all these
people who were saying we are
volunteering to be a guinea pig to
understand the long-term Health
consequences the time has passed and
we&amp;#39;re never going to know because we
didn&amp;#39;t get the money to do the very
small amount of money to do that study
then so you asked that question the
answer is I don&amp;#39;t know I tried like hell
to find out do you think that there&amp;#39;s
someone influencing them to not fund
these studies because they don&amp;#39;t want
responsibility for this bills yeah I
thought a lot about that I think in this
particular case it was just bureaucratic
 and too many people being
distracted there&amp;#39;s a lot of that there&amp;#39;s
a lot of that right and and and look
sometimes to be clear there is outright
malevolence there&amp;#39;s lobbyists who are in
their ear I think with this case it was
just you know a bunch of people in rural
Ohio that nobody except for you know a
few of us I care about them obviously
but no person in the in the Harris
Administration cared about and so when
we went to the White House and just said
you could move money like even just give
us a couple million dollars to collect
the samples and get the study started
and then we&amp;#39;ll privately fund it down
the road we couldn&amp;#39;t get anything from
them and I think it was just they were
like ah we got bigger fish to fry do so
do you know what efforts have been made
to clean that area up or what actually
look we we we&amp;#39;ve definitely does it show
what it
is
25,800 gallons of TX
25,800 what&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s the car that&amp;#39;s
the car ID Gall was on it the capacity
and the context is 100,000 gallons of
that yeah oh each car has oh each car
had different stuff yeah each car had
different stuff so What&amp;#39;s the total of
all of it somewhere like that&amp;#39;s 100,000
that&amp;#39;s another like 3 Millions 350,000
gallons or
so are millions of liters um but look I
mean and all that stuff just leaks into
the groundwater it goes into a lot
people it&amp;#39;s a rural are a lot of people
are on well water um you know a lot of
people are just you know breathing in
the air I mean and we don&amp;#39;t even know
what the health consequences are for
those folks for years we we won&amp;#39;t know
and we we may never really know because
we didn&amp;#39;t collect the samples at the
time because you got to establish the
Baseline that was what my epidemiologist
guy that I talked to in in um North
Carolina said you&amp;#39;ve got to establish
the Baseline because here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going
to happen right fast forward 10 years
people get weird cancers sometimes
because of chemical spills come
sometimes just because that&amp;#39;s human
biology somebody will sue the train
company which is um uh nor Norfolk I
think norfol southern will sue sue the
train company and they&amp;#39;ll say I&amp;#39;ve got
this weird because of you and what
norfol southern will say is no you don&amp;#39;t
you don&amp;#39;t have this weird cancer because
of me you have it because of just you
know you you sort of lost the game of
Russian Roulette that is human biology
and what we could have said conclusively
was yes or no and unfortunately we&amp;#39;re
not going to be able to say that this is
one of the things like when we&amp;#39;re in
office the first not the first but the
first disaster that we have hopefully
there aren&amp;#39;t any but there always are
First Chemical disaster that we are
we&amp;#39;re going to take the infrastructure
of that study and right away we&amp;#39;re going
to try to establish a baseline is it
possible to I mean is when you when you
have a spill of that magnitude can you
actually get everything out of the
ground do you have to just remove all
the ground like how would you you have
to test the groundw to make sure that it
doesn&amp;#39;t to to their credit and you&amp;#39;re
not going to hear me P pray praising uh
the these guys that much but the the
local EPA folks I actually think did a
pretty good job there on the water side
because they basically did is they just
ran the water in the Creeks through you
know a filtration system cleaned it
oxidized it and then got the chemicals
out of it and then put it back into the
system now the problem is the stuff
that&amp;#39;s just in the ground you can&amp;#39;t
really get that out right right you have
to remove the ground you&amp;#39;d have to
remove the ground and clean I don&amp;#39;t even
know how you would clean it I don&amp;#39;t know
if we have the capacity to clean it uh
what what you what you can do is try to
you know as we did we passed out bottle
water and tried to make sure that people
weren&amp;#39;t drinking the water and until the
levels of toxins hit a certain level and
again but but the issue was never like
the levels of toxins are going to kill
you the issue is always are they going
to cause long-term problems that is that
that we got so focused I think the media
got so focused on is the water safe to
drink and it&amp;#39;s like the question is not
is the water safe to drink the question
is is the water safe to drink for the
next 15 years right and we&amp;#39;re never
going to know the answer to that
question yeah people are terrified of
this idea of um someone
sabotaging um things like that that have
trains to contain toxic chemicals people
are terrified about the um sabotaging of
the Grid in particular that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one
that a lot of people have talked about
that we we&amp;#39;re very vulnerable like what
what can be done to sort of Shore that
up it seems like cyber attacks are
possible physical attacks are possible
yeah and if the grid goes down we&amp;#39;re we
have a real problem right uh we do have
a real problem look my you know there&amp;#39;s
New York Times or somebody else reported
recently that my phone was allegedly
hacked by Chinese hackers and so oh no
what they get yeah uh I don&amp;#39;t think
anything um nothing come on man I got
anything in there we&amp;#39;ll find we&amp;#39;ll find
we&amp;#39;ll find out man we&amp;#39;ll find out um got
any memes you probably should should
have share with your friends some some
some offensive memes and you know me me
telling my wife uh to get an extra
gallon of milk at the grocery store I
mean I you know luckily I&amp;#39;m a pretty
boring guy so I don&amp;#39;t think that they
got really anything we&amp;#39;ll find out it&amp;#39;s
boring if your phone gets hacked that&amp;#39;s
right that&amp;#39;s right well it also I mean
it&amp;#39;s apparently they couldn&amp;#39;t get the
encrypted messages that were in sent so
I&amp;#39;m pretty careful about like making
sure I use signal and iMessage and all
that stuff anyway so I mean look maybe
they got some stuff we&amp;#39;ll find out
eventually I try not to worry too much
about I can&amp;#39;t control but um one
thing that came up by the way in that
and I&amp;#39;ll get back to your your question
is about the grid one thing that came up
in that is the way that they hacked and
it was also president Trump Trump&amp;#39;s
phone apparently too the way that they
hacked our phones is they used the
backdoor Telecom infrastructure that had
been developed in the wake of the
Patriot Act and this is something that I
think should be a much bigger part of
the controversy over the Patriot Act is
when when the Patriot Act was passed
like AT&amp;amp;T Verizon they had to build all
of these systems so that if somebody got
a fisa warrant and could hack into a
particular phone the infrastructure
actually existed what I&amp;#39;ve been told is
that that infrastructure was used by
this Chinese hacker organization called
salt typhoon and that&amp;#39;s how they got
into to the Verizon network and that&amp;#39;s
how they got into the AT&amp;amp;T network what
a great name by the way salt typhoon
it&amp;#39;s a pretty badass name right if they
have anything on me I can&amp;#39;t be too
pissed off atam at least they they named
themselves salt typhoon but the the
answer the question about the grid is
this is actually it&amp;#39;s one of these
things where if we had a functional
government it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to to
develop the systems because if you do
like an EMP attack right I Ron Johnson
who&amp;#39;s a senator from Wisconsin is really
preoccupied with this you know it
doesn&amp;#39;t take down the whole grid what it
really screws with is the power
transformer system so what we should
have is basically a backup power
transformer for every major system in
the United States of America just
sitting in a w Warehouse that&amp;#39;s turned
off and because it&amp;#39;s turned off it won&amp;#39;t
be affected by an EMP pulse and then if
there is an EMP attack you just get
those Transformers to swap out the ones
that were destroyed and then the grid is
back up and running if it&amp;#39;s actually a
scandal I think that the federal
government has not just at one point
with all the money that we spend on
defense and everything else just said
we&amp;#39;re going to spend $15 billion to buy
enough power Transformers to have a
backup for every Transformer in the
country we should do that yeah one of
the things that Trump talked about that
a lot of people probably weren&amp;#39;t aware
of was the damage that these wind
turbines are doing to whales I wasn&amp;#39;t
totally aware of it I I had no idea
until I watched your podcast with him I
knew a little bit about it but I I
didn&amp;#39;t read about it until after I
talked to him it&amp;#39;s a real problem it&amp;#39;s a
very real problem and what a conundrum
for people that are so-called
environmentalists that think that wind
is like this the cleanest option when
it&amp;#39;s not the turbines don&amp;#39;t last you
can&amp;#39;t recycle them it doesn&amp;#39;t work in
salt water in particular which is what
most of the world&amp;#39;s water is I think
wind is the biggest scam out there it&amp;#39;s
total it&amp;#39;s also pollution when
I see those gigantic wind they&amp;#39;re ugly
they&amp;#39;re gross they&amp;#39;re ugly I mean I I
thought this uh where where were me and
my wife we used to be in road trips
before we had a secret service detail
and we took a road trip the good old
days man we took a road trip through
Kansas or Nebraska maybe it was Iowa um
it was it was one of the I mean we went
through all three of those States but I
can&amp;#39;t remember where you just go for
miles and miles and you see nothing but
wind turbin and it&amp;#39;s like this is
beautiful American Countryside that used
to be green Rolling Hills and now you
have these disgusting dystopian wi
turbines I&amp;#39;m sorry they are ugly I will
die on this hill they&amp;#39;re ugly I don&amp;#39;t
want them in American society and
nuclear power plants are actually more
efficient safer and you don&amp;#39;t have the
problem like we think about the problems
of nuclear waste like they&amp;#39;ve kind of
sorted a lot of those out they haven&amp;#39;t
sorted out the problems of getting rid
of these turbines no they haven&amp;#39;t not at
all I I have a buddy of mine who lives
in South Texas and I went to visit him
and you you drive down there and it&amp;#39;s
like an hour of turbines they&amp;#39;re
everywhere there&amp;#39;s so many of you just
see them as like the sky is turning dark
you see these things just spinning it
just looks gross they kill the birds
they apparently kill the wh kill a lot
of birds if you look underneath them
it&amp;#39;s like bird graveyards it&amp;#39;s crazy
yeah it really is and it&amp;#39;s clean it&amp;#39;s
green it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re brainwashed
to think that these things somehow or
another are beneficial cuz they&amp;#39;re
attached to this idea of being
environmentally conscious and I got I I
I got the thought behind them right I
understand why we were trying to turn
that&amp;#39;s obviously a source of energy cuz
you have wind blowing through that&amp;#39;s
energy that we should capture but we&amp;#39;re
just not that good at it with this right
maybe efficient right just accept that
it was a mistake it&amp;#39;s not that efficient
the political or the environmental costs
are pretty significant you know solar I
I think is actually a little bit more
reasonable because you can get a lot
more of the power they last a little bit
longer they&amp;#39;re not nearly as ugly and
you can put them in places where people
don&amp;#39;t frankly want to live that much
anyway like like in deserts and things
like that well they do those roofs now
like Tesla does solar roof the solar
roof I think that&amp;#39;s a great way right
that&amp;#39;s just empty space but wind I think
we just should say this was a failed
experiment we&amp;#39;re going to stop
subsidizing this and if people want to
have a wind turbine great but we&amp;#39;re not
going to build miles and miles of wind
turbines anymore at least not with
taxpayer subsidy but I I just hope
people recognize that the tradeoff is
not worth it like you&amp;#39;re getting a
little bit of electricity you&amp;#39;re really
ruining the landscape you&amp;#39;re ruining the
view you&amp;#39;re killing birds you&amp;#39;re messing
up whales and those things don&amp;#39;t last
that long and then you got to get rid of
them you got to put them in a landfill
like the whole thing&amp;#39;s bananas it&amp;#39;s
totally bananas and again it&amp;#39;s we focus
on the carbon footprint thing and we
don&amp;#39;t talk about the fact that there are
these massive environmental hazards that
goes back to the distracted politics
versus the real stuff and we should be
talking about the real environmental
consequences of also no it&amp;#39;s one of
those things that again is much like a
religion where you you must stay with
the doctrine you must you must follow it
by the word because if you step out of
line and say actually when you look at
these studies it doesn&amp;#39;t really show
that the world is warming it shows that
over the last x amount of thousands of
years we&amp;#39;re in a gradual cooling period
and that what&amp;#39;s really terrifying is
global cooling yes you know Randall
Carlson who&amp;#39;s an expert in uh asteroid
collisions and the younger D impact
Theory fascinating guy but he says that
like the periods the periods in in
history where we came very close to
extinction are like when there&amp;#39;s an Ice
Age yes like those are the most
terrifying that&amp;#39;s right when there&amp;#39;s
global warming you just move to where
it&amp;#39;s not so warm and that&amp;#39;s what people
have done forever well and you and you
deal with it technologically right this
is the thing that the solution to global
warming for however long this warming
Trends Trend lasts is to deal with it
technologically right if you look at the
number of people who die from disasters
in the United States it&amp;#39;s going down
because we&amp;#39;ve gotten better at
predicting stuff and helping people deal
with things and of course you still have
terrible things like hurricane Helen but
they are luckily part of a downward
Trend and people losing their lives from
terrible storms and you know if if you
really think like if you really think
that carbon this is another reason why
I&amp;#39;m somewhat skeptical of like the
carbon obsessives is if you think that
carbon is the most significant thing the
the sole focus of American civilization
should be to reduce the carbon foot of
the world then you would be investing in
nuclear in a big way and then when you
say that the environmentalists say well
you&amp;#39;ve got all these poison rocks to
deal with afterwards well the poison
rocks problem is a less significant
problem than the carbon problem if you
think that we&amp;#39;re all going to go extinct
in 100 years so let&amp;#39;s deal with the most
pressing problem they&amp;#39;re all like no no
no no and their solution is to buy solar
panels that are disproportionately made
in China which has the worst carbon
footprint and growing of any country in
the entire world
they obviously don&amp;#39;t believe their own
 which is why I&amp;#39;m somewhat
skeptical of what they say also when you
have a movement and your spokesperson is
Greta thurnberg and not some insanely
intelligent scientist who&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s done years
of research on this stuff and there&amp;#39;s
also not a consensus among scientists
there&amp;#39;s a lot of scientists that are
Heretics that are stepping outside the
lines that are saying that this is not
an issue and then they&amp;#39;re also pointing
out the fact that carbon is what trees
consume and there&amp;#39;s more Greenery in the
world today than there was 100 years ago
which is a very inconvenient thing for
people see I didn&amp;#39;t realize that yeah I
had no idea that&amp;#39;s true well carbon is
what trees feed off so I knew carbon is
what trees feed off of I didn&amp;#39;t know
there was more Greenery than there was
100 years ago that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s interesting
not only that you got Bill Gates that&amp;#39;s
saying planting trees is not a solution
to the carbon problem like wait a second
this is this is so not true it&amp;#39;s so not
true and it&amp;#39;s also historically like one
of the the the craziest in history in my
opinion is the Mongols and what the
Mongols did in the 1200s they lowered
the carbon footprint of Earth because
they killed so many people they killed
10% of the population of Earth that that
is crazy and because of that because
they they devastated these places and
killed so many people trees grew more
trees grew and it lowered the carbon
foot these places that had been overcome
by agriculture were then Rec consumed by
nature and it lowered the carbon
footprint of Earth well there is a
fundamentally it raises the point
there&amp;#39;s a fundamentally anti-human
element of the radical environmental
movement in the United States of America
they&amp;#39;re saying we have to reduce
population this is one and when they say
it with vaccines you&amp;#39;re like slow down
that&amp;#39;s right did you just say that all
loud yes and then when you if you
read Robert F Kennedy&amp;#39;s Jr and I
encourage everyone to read Robert F
Kennedy Junior&amp;#39;s book the real Anthony
fouchy because it&amp;#39;s not just about this
crisis that we went through with
covid-19 it&amp;#39;s about a a host of
different things that were done and one
of them was a vaccine That was supposed
to be a DPT vaccine that they were
giving to girls in Africa that was just
birth control it was just sterilizing
them wow and that they were I didn&amp;#39;t
realize they were giving them HCG and
that they were giving them this uh
enhanced schedule I don&amp;#39;t want to screw
this up because my recall is not the
best I don&amp;#39;t want to but the reality is
there was experiments done on unwitting
unknowing African women where they gave
them this thing that was supposed to be
a vaccine against a disease but it was
really sterilizing them and they&amp;#39;re
experimenting dark again that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
like the Native American oxycon thing
Global Health like there&amp;#39;s a lot of
experimenting going on that&amp;#39;s right
that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s they we we pulled up an AP
article I had Alex Jones telling me this
I was like what it&amp;#39;s like they gave him
polio they TR the vaccine they gave him
polio like what so
AP article that shows that a lot of they
had to stop giving these kids in Africa
this polio vaccine because it was
actually giving them polio that&amp;#39;s crazy
like because they experiment because
this is how they find out if stuff works
so you get people with no internet
connection they live in dirt floors
we&amp;#39;re going to help you and then they
come in they experiment on them and it&amp;#39;s
so dark that is so dark and it&amp;#39;s all
done through this idea of philanthropy
yeah yeah and it&amp;#39;s crazy and they profit
off of it the whole thing is Madness and
because they have so much influence and
so much power and so much money is being
generated they&amp;#39;re allowed to get away
with these things just think about like
that from the perspective of these poor
people I I assume the polio vaccine
thing happened in Africa or it happened
somewhere else so okay so you&amp;#39;re in
Africa some white dude shows up says
that he cares about you gives you a shot
that&amp;#39;s going to you know prevent you
from getting some disease and then you
become like permanently disabled or you
even die because of it like think about
what effect that has on how those
Africans perceive our civilization and
are we going to have you know are they
going to like we&amp;#39;re going to have a
conflict in 3040 years because people
are so pissed off about us coming in and
and giving them health care that isn&amp;#39;t
actually health care I really worry
about that stuff I mean this is one of
my big things with the Russia Ukraine
conflict is people don&amp;#39;t realize how
much of Africa&amp;#39;s food supply comes from
the Ukraine like a an astonishing amount
so if you have this war that goes on
forever and there&amp;#39;s not enough food
going to Africa are are you going to
have a bunch of starving desperate
people who are like pissed off because
they&amp;#39;re starving who hate European
civilization because they don&amp;#39;t have you
know they&amp;#39;re not getting the food that
they were expecting to get like we never
think about the KnockOn effects of this
stuff right you&amp;#39;re like yeah it&amp;#39;s really
dark and really evil that we&amp;#39;re giving
them Polio I also wonder the people who
live in the village that got polio what
the hell are they going to be doing in
30 years they&amp;#39;re probably going to hate
us yeah I would be really upset if you
gave my kid polio over here justifiably
so justifiably so I&amp;#39;d hate these people
right you give my kid polio under the
pretense of helping them it&amp;#39;s crazy but
you know then there&amp;#39;s also
pharmaceutical drugs that are really
beneficial and this is the thing like
they have to have guard rails yeah you
have to have some ril and regulations to
keep these people from just NeverEnding
profits cuz they always gravitate
towards that they always gravitate
towards making the most amount of money
and again this is where I go back to
some of the arguments of the old left
like what kind of guard rails do you
want these companies to have do you want
the guard rails to be that if donate to
the trans pride and BLM organizations
you get to do whatever the hell you want
or do you want the guard rails like
we&amp;#39;re going to protect health and Public
Safety and make sure that you&amp;#39;re not
like killing people under the ospice of
helping them yeah and that that&amp;#39;s the
kind of guard rails I want the com
logical yeah very logical but logic is
you know dangerous today
like logic oh man logic is uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
a problem when you have ideology and
people strictly logic is a colonial idea
man you got to get away from the logic
that&amp;#39;s math is racist I don&amp;#39;t that
that&amp;#39;s a new one well okay so this is
interesting there&amp;#39;s this movie that&amp;#39;s
probably like extremely influential to
my entire political worldview and I
didn&amp;#39;t realize until last night cuz I
got into Austin late usually my wife
travels with me she wasn&amp;#39;t with me last
night she&amp;#39;s taking care of the kids
today so I get I get in the hotel room
in Austin and it&amp;#39;s very late and I watch
this movie boys in the hood have you
ever seen boys in the hood oh yeah sure
okay I watched that movie a ton when I
was like 8 n years old and I didn&amp;#39;t
realize how much that movie has had an
influence on me until I watched it last
night okay so all right Furious Styles a
lot of his stuff about not letting
financial institutions buy up all the
stuff in your community obviously he&amp;#39;s
talking about black people in LA and not
you know white people in you know rural
small town America but I was like oh
like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s maybe the first place
that I ever heard this idea or he talks
about like the importance of Father Hood
the importance of especially young boys
having a father in the home it&amp;#39;s like I
got that from boys in the hood and
obviously it spoke to me when I was a
kid because I grew up at the time and I
didn&amp;#39;t have my much of a relationship
with my dad and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting
man he makes this observation math being
racist he&amp;#39;s criticizing the SAT for
being culturally biased but then he says
the only part that isn&amp;#39;t culturally
biased is the
math and it&amp;#39;s like oh this is like a
black nationalist in the mid 80s cuz
that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind of the philosophy of
this movie as what you might call like
old school black leftism this movie in
the 1980s is saying something that I I
wish a lot of white liberals would hear
today which is actually math is not
racist
it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one of the things that&amp;#39;s like
not def definitively not racist is math
and numbers you guys are losing your
damn Minds well math is racist is one of
those ones where you it&amp;#39;s like if you
heard that in a cocktail party you&amp;#39;d be
like what like if someone behind you was
saying math is racist you&amp;#39;d be like what
the we got to get out of here honey
I&amp;#39;d say I want to go I want one of what
they&amp;#39;re having I want to hang out with
those guys that&amp;#39;s so okay by the way
this is my the you know an active
bipartisanship the one thing that
Republicans man that were really I think
we got really wrong in the last few
years is the anti- hunter Biden stuff I
want to go hang out with Hunter
Biden I mean I may the only Republican
that dude that dude he was like H Thom
without the writing Talent
that guy went hard you got to give it to
him I would bet I would bet $100 than
Hunter Biden is voting for Donald Trump
for president it well it doesn&amp;#39;t seem
like he likes his dad it seems like he
his dad I might I might bet $20 on his
dad voting for Donald Trump for
president last night after the garbage
comment yeah uh you know that guy is
trying to help Donald Trump you&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re
going to win I think we&amp;#39;re going to win
but after we win I&amp;#39;m going to be
convinced that Joe Biden was trying to
help us the whole time mag hat the Maga
hat was crazy that was crazy when he put
on the Maga hat in front of those guys
and they all cheered and he insisted on
keeping the hat and he took it with him
I think he&amp;#39;s very very resentful that he
got ousted in what was essentially a
coup yeah and and I&amp;#39;d love to know what
what happened there by way I would love
to know what happen I have to use the
restroom we come back let&amp;#39;s talk about
that because this important I just have
to PE be right back so the the the
wildest thing about the laptop was that
they were able to suppress it from
social media and wild when I discussed
that with Zuckerberg and he openly
admitted it that the FBI had contacted
him and told him that it was Russian
disinformation and like that was one of
those things while he was saying I was
like yo I was like this guy&amp;#39;s like just
saying this yeah and I remember when
that episode came out because it like it
reverberated across American politics
like crazy holy he just said the
thing that we all suspected for a very
long time and if it wasn&amp;#39;t for Elon
purchasing Twitter and then and finding
out how much of an influence they were
having on this and that they were in
fact silencing something that they knew
to be correct under a lie under a lie
and 51 Former Intelligence agents signed
off on this right who&amp;#39;s like how did you
how did they pull that off like just
pulling pulling that off is really wild
and the fact that there was no outrage
from the left that the left was like
it&amp;#39;s fine because it&amp;#39;s our side and
Trump is evil and he&amp;#39;s Hitler we got to
get rid of him so let&amp;#39;s just lie about
this laptop and no consequences nothing
right the same people that pushed it are
still by they still all have security
clearances I believe which is going to
change when we win but um I mean also
this is this is where I always get
pissed about the media conversation
around what happened in 2020 is what
they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll
sort of find the craziest conspiracy
theory about what happened in 2020
they&amp;#39;ll debunk it and say oh look this
this thing we this shows that nothing
bad happened in 2020 there&amp;#39;s a
nonpartisan organization that actually
looked at what would have happened to
Americans votes if they had just known
the truth about the fact that Joe Biden
fundamentally had traded his political
influence for money like that&amp;#39;s what it
was it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an old-fashioned
American corruption story I will give
you access to powerful people in
exchange for money right that was the
true Scandal of the hunter Biden laptop
again it wasn&amp;#39;t Hunter Biden doing
cocaine with a stripper that was the fun
part you can say
that I have an election went um
so that was the real SC corrup it was
the corruption
and and and and direct evidence the the
corruption and a nonpartisan or
organization said that knowledge which
was suppressed by the entire American
Media and big Tech scene that would have
changed Millions upon millions of votes
and we know that the number in four
swing States was 88,000 votes that were
the difference between Donald Trump and
Joe Biden winning the 2020 election so
set to the side all of the other
arguments about fraud and all the other
rule changes that happened in the midst
of Co we know that big Tech colluded
with our own sort of I would say
colluded the one thing I&amp;#39;ll say about
Zuckerberg is and I like I don&amp;#39;t know
him super well I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem
with them but I do wonder if it&amp;#39;s a
convenient excuse I don&amp;#39;t doubt that the
FBI said hey this is Russian
disinformation but these companies still
have to take some agency over this too
right so I think it was both the
corruption of the FBI and the
intelligence services but also the big
technology companies themselves both of
them are at blame and I think
fundamentally if they had not done what
they did Donald Trump would have won
another term as president United States
you you&amp;#39;re never going to be able to
convince me that if Millions upon
millions of Swing voters knew the
evidence of Joe Biden&amp;#39;s corruption and
it was staring them in the face that we
would not have been able to to pull that
one out well Zuckerberg has gotten
really into mixed martial arts he&amp;#39;s
gotten really into jiujitsu and really
into training and there&amp;#39;s very few
things that will turn you into a
conservative more than martial arts
training like every there&amp;#39;s no way to
get ahead other than hard work well have
you seen all these studies um that
basically connect testosterone levels
and young men with conservative politics
oh yeah yeah so maybe that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s
going on well it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a certain
amount maybe that&amp;#39;s why the Democrats
want us all to be you know poor health
and overweight is because that means
they going to be no it means we&amp;#39;re going
to be more liberal right if you if you
make people less healthy they apparently
become more politically liberal that&amp;#39;s
an interesting observation well I think
there&amp;#39;s like socially liberal like Live
and Let Live do whatever you want as
long as you&amp;#39;re not hurting anybody which
is really what I am and then the reality
yeah these labels get all confused right
yeah and this is where it gets sort of
conflated like the reality of hard work
being a virtue yes and this has always
been a conservative idea is that you&amp;#39;re
really supposed to like make your mark
in this world and get up in the morning
and work hard and you should be proud of
that yes the only way to get good at
Jiu-Jitsu is hard work yes so everybody
who really trains hard and gets good has
a certain level of a just a true
understanding of the real relationship
that the actual the mathematical
equation of focus time energy and
discipline versus positive results and
there&amp;#39;s only one way to excel there&amp;#39;s no
other way to excel at martial arts other
than training hard so it&amp;#39;s kind of
normal that he&amp;#39;s becoming like leaning
more libertarian and wearing hoodies now
yeah no my my my secret jacked my secret
theory is is that Zuck is now a trump
supporter but he can&amp;#39;t say that publicly
of course but um hopefully he is really
difficult to say that now that&amp;#39;s why
guys like Bill Amman and chamath and all
these people that stand out it&amp;#39;s taking
real courage it has yeah and I I like
both of those guys they really do get
excommunicated absolutely they yeah
cocktail parties are a mess after that
in M
County they think you&amp;#39;re a Nazi and
that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s putting it mildly but yeah
I mean like you know one of my closest
friends in the tech world is David Sachs
and Dave and I have talked about this
because we were both like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
funny we were both sort of critical of
trump in 2016 but we came you know at
that criticism from a ride to Center
perspective and both of us by 2020 were
like this crazy has to end
Trump is our guy and maybe not only is
he our guy but maybe he was like the
only one who could have turned the tide
against this insanity and David I mean
he has become so far out there and I
admire it in a lot of ways but then
sometimes I see what David says and I&amp;#39;m
like dude are you going to be like
welcome in what is he say in your
neighborhood well I mean have you ever
interviewed David sax well I mean he&amp;#39;s
he&amp;#39;s just look he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s very anti-woke
he&amp;#39;s very very into foreign what I would
call foreign policy realism like why are
we starting these stupid Wars all over
the world we should be our foreign
policy should be more pro peace and it
it&amp;#39;s just crazy to me because he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s
so inflammatory about it that I&amp;#39;m and by
the way I love it right I you know I
agree with with what a lot of what David
says and even when I disagree I know
he&amp;#39;s a smart guy but he is just saying
look I don&amp;#39;t give a if you&amp;#39;re going
to come after me come after me but I&amp;#39;m
going to say what&amp;#39;s on my mind and I
think you know a lot of people are going
in that direction which is fundamentally
a good thing is is people are sick of
being told what to think and like the
first amendment obviously it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a
legal document that talks about the role
of government in censorship and sort of
prohibits government censorship but it&amp;#39;s
also a sort of ethic and an attitude
that is in demic or I hope is to
American society which is we&amp;#39;re going to
think what we want we&amp;#39;re going to say
what we want to that&amp;#39;s an important
First Amendment value even though it has
nothing to do with the First Amendment
as a legal document itself and a lot of
people are sick of being told what to
think I was very upset when Tim wal was
saying that the First Amendment doesn&amp;#39;t
apply to hate speech and misinformation
like especially those two terms hate
speech and misinformation because hate
spech they in the eye of the beholder
right it&amp;#39;s so subjective and it&amp;#39;s the
the the the marks are moving as to
what&amp;#39;s called hate speech now it&amp;#39;s
moving further and further away from
normal say that an 11-year-old should
not get gender transition drugs that is
hate speech according to a significant
subset of left yeah if you call Caitlyn
Jenner Bruce Jenner that&amp;#39;s hate speech a
lot of people would say that&amp;#39;s hate
speech and you used to get banned for
life from Twitter for dead naming
someone yes which is just bananas which
is totally Banas calling you can call
him a but you you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t
call him Bruce the whole thing is so
crazy it&amp;#39;s just it and but it like I I
think that this is and look I&amp;#39;m try not
to be too partisan cuz I know a lot of
people watch your show but this is to me
the biggest the most fundamental
difference between Kamala and president
Trump in the campaign is you know
whether it&amp;#39;s Biden calling people
garbage or Tim walz calling people
fascist and kamla calling people Nazis
or endorsing explicit censorship we&amp;#39;re
not trying to censor our fellow
Americans right we&amp;#39;ll Tac comma and our
policies and our ideas but we&amp;#39;re not
trying to say you should be silenced
because you disagree with us that is
anathema to everything that I believe in
and that is what&amp;#39;s happen in the in the
modern democratic party at least at the
leadership level is they&amp;#39;ve gotten
really comfortable with the idea of
silencing people who disagree with them
such to the point where like it&amp;#39;s not
even that Tim Waltz thinks that hate
speech should be censored it&amp;#39;s that the
governor of a state could utter that
phrase without recognizing how
fundamentally subjective it is right
we&amp;#39;re or Hillary Clinton saying that we
want to censor misinformation she has
come out and explicitly said that we
have to censor disinformation and L
total control or we like hey you&amp;#39;re not
supposed to have
control that&amp;#39;s the whole point is you
don&amp;#39;t want people to have total control
and they they can utter it without the
American Media going completely bananas
just suggests there&amp;#39;s something broken
about the political culture of the left
I mean there are people on CNN and you
know CBS and all these other sort of
mainstream networks i&amp;#39; would call them
corporate networks all these corporate
networks that will say you know when
Donald J Trump says that if you riot
after after the election you&amp;#39;re the
enemy of the people or you&amp;#39;re an enemy
within like that is a major threat to
democracy but Hillary Clinton is saying
that we should censor disinformation
they&amp;#39;re just yeah no no big deal and the
fact that they can get so fired up about
what I think is a pretty Common Sense
observation that if you Riot law
enforcement should have a response to it
but they think that it&amp;#39;s the end of the
they don&amp;#39;t care at all don&amp;#39;t care at all
when Hillary Clinton and Tim WS Endor
explicit censorship that should scare
the hell out of us it should scare the
out of you whenever any politician is
encouraging censorship especially when
it&amp;#39;s about things like we said about
hate speech and misinformation like
misinformation according to who because
we&amp;#39;ve already shown that
there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a bunch of different
factors that have control over what is
presented as fact yes and they&amp;#39;re not
always honest or accurate and these
things get put out and it harms people
and then there&amp;#39;s some sort of a
correction that comes along well the
only way find that out especially like
during the covid times these things that
they called misinformation how many of
them turned out to be true almost all of
them it&amp;#39;s crazy the Wuhan lab it was
racist racist to assume that the when
John Stewart did that bit on Co bear did
you see that I have never seen it though
it&amp;#39;s amazing CU you see coar scrambling
and he&amp;#39;s trying to like John&amp;#39;s like do
you think maybe the lab that was the
Wuhan Corona virus lab lab that like
maybe it came from there like it was it
was so obvious I mean the the whole
argument for the start of Co that wasn&amp;#39;t
from the Wuhan lab was basically As I
understood it that a bat had gotten a
weird Corona virus and had like fallen
into a guy&amp;#39;s soup at a wet you know a
was involved there so much stupidity
involved and that&amp;#39;s like that was more
believable than there&amp;#39;s the Wuhan Corona
virus lab and yeah I I remember when you
Tom Cotton was the first major American
politician to talk about this you know
Tom&amp;#39;s like a good friend and he was
immediately pillared as this terrible
racist and you know it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s
bizarre that we&amp;#39;re not allowed to talk
about things in the United States of
America I will say I think it&amp;#39;s gotten
better this is one of my more optimistic
views is you know when we were all
locked in our houses in the summer of
2020 I think that did weird things
psychologically to everybody agree and I
think that a lot of people rebelled
against it and we&amp;#39;re probably in a
better position now in 2024 like chamath
would not have come out I love chamath
would not have come out for Donald Trump
in 2020 right right now he&amp;#39;s hosting
fundraisers and giving hundreds of
thousands of dollars to to our campaign
so I I think the fact that you have so
many old school liberals and old school
leftists say we&amp;#39;re done with this
 is actually a pretty good sign
yeah there&amp;#39;s still social consequences
to it but not nearly as high as they
were four years ago well I think when
Elon purchased Twitter it changed the
entire ire game cuz now you have this
wild west uncensored version of social
media that&amp;#39;s run by this Super Genius
mad man who has all the money in the
world right it&amp;#39;s a crazy I mean it&amp;#39;s
really without him we&amp;#39;re in a lot of
trouble because let&amp;#39;s say Twitter never
gets purchased they run the same way
they&amp;#39;ve run it in the past where they&amp;#39;re
being influenced by whatever companies
and whatever agencies decide to remove
posts move people and ban Donald Trump
and ban a bunch of different
conservatives and ban a bunch of people
that were outcasts and just they just
decided they were controlling the
discourse well then you have no Outlets
other than parlor and we discussed this
yesterday those Outlets 100% got
Infested by Bots where absolutely where
they&amp;#39;re putting Nazi stuff up and like
oh this is a Nazi site like no you&amp;#39;re
the na you put it up there you poisoned
it instead of it being just a place
where conservatives can go and talk
about things and not be censored like
they were on Twitter then they get
infiltrated with all this hate and
then it becomes a hateful place and they
don&amp;#39;t even want to go so now they&amp;#39;re
homeless that&amp;#39;s right well now all of a
sudden Twitter comes along Elon comes
along has this complete shift in how
he&amp;#39;s viewing this attack on Free Speech
then you have shellenberger and Matt
taibe they go into the Twitter files
they find like oh my God like this is
this is unconstitutional this industrial
scale censorship is what it was
and they weren&amp;#39;t right they they did all
this stuff and it turned out that all
the things they were saying were either
lies or were Incorrect corre and there&amp;#39;s
no repercussions and so you&amp;#39;re seeing
all this in real time and no one on the
left has any problem with it which to me
is insanity and the people that do have
a problem with it their solution seems
to be to just go to the right they don&amp;#39;t
even feel like you can reform the left
they just people are just like tulsy
gabard becomes a republican people just
abandoning this like I can&amp;#39;t talk to you
people that&amp;#39;s right I&amp;#39;m doing an event
with Tulsa gabber tonight in
Pennsylvania I love her she&amp;#39;s awesome
and uh yeah I think she basically
decided that the left cannot be reformed
in this country anymore that&amp;#39;s what
happened with Bobby Kennedy that&amp;#39;s
what&amp;#39;s happened with a lot of old old
school liberals is they say yeah you
know we don&amp;#39;t care what you do in your
bedroom but we we believe in the
fundamental right of people to speak
their mind and the Democrats just don&amp;#39;t
believe in that anymore and I thought a
lot about like what&amp;#39;s you know what what
is going on there and what&amp;#39;s driving it
psychologically and I I think that I
think what&amp;#39;s going on is the entire
modern democratic party grew up in an
era where there was consensus right
Walter kronite could say something about
the Vietnam War and it turned out he&amp;#39;s
probably right about that actually and
it collapsed public support for the
Vietnam War where they grew up in in in
America where social social trust was
just so much higher and I think that a
lot of them are trying to
reimpose that social Trust on from the
top not recognizing that that high level
of social trust came organically from
the way that American society worked and
if you have people trying to reimpose it
from the top it actually degrades the
very thing that you&amp;#39;re trying to create
because I&amp;#39;ve seen I mean family members
of mine who got really radicalized
because they were like wait a second
should we be masking three-year-olds in
our schools like does that do something
to their language development and then
they would get kicked off of Facebook
because a person with 900 Facebook
friends who has no public profile dared
to like question the prevailing
narrative and again they ended up being
right about it I actually think that
what the left is doing is degrading
social trust by trying to create it from
on high and I kind of get the
psychological impulse because you know
like a lot of great things that we do
come from high levels of social trust
but you&amp;#39;ve got to reestablish it
organically you can&amp;#39;t try to force it on
people and there&amp;#39;s been some course
correcting like did you read uh bezos&amp;#39;s
article was it yesterday that came out
the Washington Post I did see that what
did you think of that I mean I I go back
and forth like again I I don&amp;#39;t know Jeff
super well I&amp;#39;ve always liked him in my
interactions with him but the problem
with the Washington Post is not that
their editorial page has been
insufficiently conservative it&amp;#39;s that
their entire journalism department is
fundamentally engaged in Democratic
political activism I mean the the two we
talk about this a lot and you know my
political guys are you know a lot of
them are outside and certainly a lot of
them will watch but we talk a lot about
which of the newspapers that have really
gone crazy and the New York Times is
kind of an exception yeah it&amp;#39;s very
left-wing but it hasn&amp;#39;t totally gone
insane The Washington Post might as well
be a propaganda Outlet of the democratic
party if you look from the hunter Biden
laptop to any number of stories where
they just tow the left-wing line almost
instinctively the problem was with the
journalism at the Washington Post it&amp;#39;s
not with the editorials I don&amp;#39;t care
frankly whether the editorial page
endorses Donald Trump or kamla Harris I
care about whether the the journalists
are lying about Donald Trump or lying
about kamla Harris and frankly they&amp;#39;re
lying a lot in the negative Direction
about my running mate and they&amp;#39;re lying
a lot in the positive direction about
kamla Harris so what I would like to see
from Jeff Bezos is a commitment to The
Washington Post not just being a
Democrat Super PAC I don&amp;#39;t give a
if he hires a few more conservative
columnists it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what
matters is do they hold their journalism
to anything like a high standard and if
they don&amp;#39;t do that then to me it&amp;#39;s just
wind addressing but it seems like that&amp;#39;s
a at least a step in the right direction
one thing would be great you have an
argument against Donald Trump on the
front page next to an argument for
Donald Trump and let two different
intelligent people State their cases one
from a conservative perspective one from
a liberal perspective and let&amp;#39;s see what
what resonates with you it&amp;#39;s a step in
the right direction I I just think that
unless you change the underl l in you
know journalism to make it more fair
it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to be only a step in the
right direction rather than fixing the
problem what else can he do I mean he&amp;#39;s
probably pretty busy on his yacht
hanging out with his girlfriend with
tight shirts
on how does he have the time you know I
mean he can&amp;#39;t go into the office and
like read everybody&amp;#39;s work okay so let
let me give you an example there is a
there&amp;#39;s a journalist by the name of Matt
Bole who writes it Breitbart do you know
Matt Bole you ever heard of Matt okay so
Matt is even though he writes for
Breitbart and I know that most people
assume that Breitbart is just this like
right-wing rag um Matt is he has one of
the best contacts of journalists in in
Washington like he knows what&amp;#39;s going to
happen in the country before most
left-wing journalists because he talks
to the Liberals he talks to the
conservatives he has allies on Capitol
Hill I&amp;#39;d love to see The Washington Post
hire a guy like Matt Bole and say Matt
go and do what you&amp;#39;re going to do and
obviously it&amp;#39;s not going to be able to
have the a political bias to it but go
investigate if you want to go
investigate K Harris&amp;#39;s campaign go and
do it but that is what it would look
like is empowering conservative and
independent journalism in the same way
that Jeff Bezos has empowered left-wing
journalism if I see that happening then
I&amp;#39;ll be a little bit more optimistic
about about his stewardship well could
you imagine if there&amp;#39;s the same sort of
scrutiny on kamala&amp;#39;s speeches and
appearances in these media Outlets as
there is on trumps oh my God like one of
the things that we talked about was how
they edited that one uh answer that she
she was asked like what you know about
foreign policy yeah they edited it
completely and I I wasn&amp;#39;t aware that
they put an answer for a completely
different question there well okay so I
I I think that what happened there
having done some try to understand that
a little bit better is they basically
just edited her answer down a lot so
that she didn&amp;#39;t sound like a total
insane person because what aired I think
on the small
you know the what air on the channels
online that had a smaller pickup was the
rambling was the rambling the word Sal
but what actually aired on the news
programs was I mean it still didn&amp;#39;t
sound very good but it sounded hell of a
lot better but let me let me give you a
very good example it&amp;#39;s really not the
answer it&amp;#39;s like they changed the answer
but let me see let me see what yeah no
you&amp;#39;re right they changed the answer but
I just wanted to find the statistic from
from my team because I asked them this
last night so they did change the answer
and they changed in a way to protect her
and then importantly they refused to to
to release the transcript right so my
attitude would be just release the
transcript let people see what she
actually said so that you at least have
some Integrity as a journalistic outlet
but okay so here here&amp;#39;s you of course
I&amp;#39;m sure paid attention to the cruffle
over a comedian at the Trump rity MSG I
think you even know this guy right he&amp;#39;s
a good friend of mine so so he tells he
tells a joke about um you know Puerto
Rico the number of mentions on CNN about
this joke in the last 48 hours this was
as of last night 143 on MSNBC 101 on ABC
53 on NBC 32 and on CBS 31 in two days
they talked about that joke effectively
non-stop you know what it means to have
31 mentions on NBC news about this
particular thing that is a crazy that is
saturation last night Joe Biden called
the half of America that&amp;#39;s going to vote
for Donald Trump garbage do you think
that the word garbage is going to appear
on CNN 141 times over the next two days
I would bet no now what&amp;#39;s the difference
well one difference is that it was a
comedian telling a joke and it&amp;#39;s the
president of the United States telling
what he actually thinks another
difference is again it&amp;#39;s a comedian with
at best a tenous connection to the Trump
campaign and on the other hand you have
the actual C
president at a vice presidential
campaign event telling the vice
president or sorry telling the entire
country at an event sanctioned by the
kamla Harris campaign that half of
Americans are garbage and I guarantee
the media is not going to cover this in
the same way I mean here let me I don&amp;#39;t
know if Jamie can bring this up but I
tweeted about this last night that
Politico when they initially tried to
write the story about what had been said
by Joe Biden they said that Biden had
called racism against Puerto Ricans
garbage well who disagrees with that I
think that racism against Puerto Ricans
is garbage but that&amp;#39;s not what he said
he said that Trump&amp;#39;s supporters are
garbage he said it&amp;#39;s on video so
Politico tried to like rcon this it
turned out there was a video so we can
actually see for ourselves what was
actually said but the amount of
dishonesty in the American Media really
is off the charts it is but also with
Joe Biden I think at this point time
he&amp;#39;s literally that crazy guy on the
porch yelling at the neighbors I mean
he&amp;#39;s no one thinks he&amp;#39;s there which is
also one of the fascinating things when
they asked her when did you know that he
was mentally impaired and why didn&amp;#39;t you
talk about it earlier and there&amp;#39;s this
Joe Biden has always done the amazing
work that Joe Biden does it&amp;#39;s just like
this l where are you going you want to
get the like the lights that they use
air traffic controller like come this
way come this way help her out do you
think she wears a earpiece oh I wouldn&amp;#39;t
be surprised I had IDE the earpiece one
was amazing little Bluetooth thing the
ear earring astonishing she talks the
only way I can describe it is she talks
in circles right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like Tim
Dylan says it&amp;#39;s like she does gypsy
curses because she speaks in Gypsy
curses that&amp;#39;s very good oh but it&amp;#39;s you
know we we need to build an opportunity
economy because if Americans don&amp;#39;t have
opportunity then they&amp;#39;re not going to
have the opportunity to be Americans and
it&amp;#39;s like what the hell the opportunity
to generate wealth and generational
wealth like wait a minute do you know
how few people generate generational
wealth that means you have so much money
you&amp;#39;re going to give it to other
Generations but there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s actually
okay I mean I give a lot of speeches so
there&amp;#39;s actually a skill to this I think
that she is the Michael Jordan of using
as many words as possible to say as
little as possible there&amp;#39;s actually a
certain gift that she has because you
listen to her talk and you you know
you&amp;#39;re 1002 words into it you&amp;#39;re 500
words into it and you&amp;#39;re like what the
hell did she just say she didn&amp;#39;t say
anything right and that actually I mean
okay so yeah there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a certain
political skill in saying a lot without
actually saying anything but it actually
worries me about her being president
like okay they&amp;#39;re all these substantive
policy disagreements and we could talk
about okay I don&amp;#39;t like her border
policies I don&amp;#39;t like this I don&amp;#39;t like
that but what does she do when she&amp;#39;s in
a meeting with a world leader and she
has to like know the details of public
policy to negotiate with Vladimir Putin
or Xi Jinping like one of the major
things that you do as a president is you
participate in economic negotiations
like what tariffs are we going to apply
on your goods unless you lower the
tariffs on ours or vice versa right you
have to be able to know a little bit
about your job to be the president of
the United States and I don&amp;#39;t know that
she has an ounce of curiosity about
public policy in this country that&amp;#39;s
what scares the hell out of me well it&amp;#39;s
just strange that everyone&amp;#39;s accepting
that this person who is the least
popular vice president
ever is now the solution to the problem
and that the media machine in just a few
days did this 180 and just sold her as
the solution and as long as they keep
her from having these conversations
where she&amp;#39;s allowed to talk that&amp;#39;s right
they&amp;#39;re able to pull this off and the
the fact that it&amp;#39;s happening with no
primary should be really concerning to
people cuz that&amp;#39;s never happened before
they could have had a primary well it&amp;#39;s
also part of the process where you
identify people&amp;#39;s flaws you figure out
what they&amp;#39;re good at what they&amp;#39;re bad at
like the primary is actually a grueling
process how you handle pressure how you
handle pressure right and we don&amp;#39;t
really know how she&amp;#39;s handled pressure
because she&amp;#39;s only done it for a little
while and if if you just look at Donald
Trump&amp;#39;s public schedule JD Vance&amp;#39;s
public schedule versus KLA Harris dude
it is striking how little she does there
was an interview that she did I think
it&amp;#39;s the only really tough interview
she&amp;#39;s done with Brett Bayer of Fox News
I believe that she had a clear calendar
for two days before she did this
interview and so they just prepping her
just just prepping her but you know how
how can you actually you know that&amp;#39;s not
pressure if you get to take two days off
for one single interview that that&amp;#39;s not
pressure and also just little things I
mean look there&amp;#39;s this story out there
to be clear I have no idea if it&amp;#39;s true
but there&amp;#39;s a woman who has gone on the
record and said that Doug mhof KLA
Harris&amp;#39;s husband smacked her in the face
in France okay that&amp;#39;s been reported on
the media I&amp;#39;m sure you guys can find it
if you want to okay again maybe it&amp;#39;s not
true maybe it is true but these things
take time to actually figure out and
investigate and here here&amp;#39;s the thing
you know you know this I know this most
people know this if you are a domestic
abuser that usually doesn&amp;#39;t stop with
one person like most domestic abusers
are serial domestic abusers is it in the
public interest to do some investigation
about whether the White House the
president could be sharing the White
House with the person who is engaged in
domestic abuse that is in the public
interest to know not only is the
American Media not that interested in it
but most importantly you don&amp;#39;t have the
time to really investigate some of these
accusations meanwhile every time
somebody says anything about Donald
Trump without an ounce of evidence the
American Media picks it up and runs with
it and makes an entire news cycle
totally incurious about what&amp;#39;s going on
with KLA Harris but I think over time
what&amp;#39;s interesting is most people are
becoming aware of this extreme bias the
difference in the scrutiny that&amp;#39;s
applied to Trump so that that&amp;#39;s right
but you you go back into this question
you asked me about Jeff Bezos this is
why you need good reporters who have the
investigatory skills who are empowered
by their employers to go out and do the
investigations like you know your
platform you&amp;#39;re having more honest and
open conversations than anything that&amp;#39;s
happening in the corporate media it&amp;#39;s
like one of the reasons why I listen to
your show one of the reasons why I&amp;#39;m
happy to be here but you don&amp;#39;t have like
a person working for you who&amp;#39;s going to
go to like France and talk to this woman
and investigate whether this is true
this is why you know I&amp;#39;ve told Elon this
but like the most useful piece of
philanthropy if you&amp;#39;re a right of Center
American would be to set up a nonprofit
organization where you pay a really good
reporter for five years you give them
complete job security and you just tell
them go off and investigate what&amp;#39;s going
on in the world and and bring it back
and and report on the truth because if
you don&amp;#39;t have that then that is where
the media still has a fundamental
advantage over us is they&amp;#39;ve got an army
of people investigating me and Donald
Trump there&amp;#39;s no one really
investigating Kell Harris well there&amp;#39;s
also the amount of left-wing media
versus right-wing media is pretty
disturbing yeah like what what what is
the percentage of networks that lean
left C CNN clearly MSNBC ABC NBC
CBS and then you have Fox then you have
Fox and then you have a couple of online
things like news nation and what have
you but and if you just reach is much
less reach is much much less and if you
just look at I mean you&amp;#39;re only you know
you and a few others are the only people
who can compare with the actual platform
size of an NBC a CBS I mean yeah fewer
people watch them now than they did 20
years ago but if you look man like
you&amp;#39;re still getting 5 to 8 million
viewers every single night for each of
the major networks on the Nightly News
that&amp;#39;s incredible reach right there&amp;#39;s
still a lot of power there and you know
to your to your point about like the
comparison you know Fox News number one
if you look at Fox news&amp;#39;s viewership
compared to NBC is there just dwarfs NBC
dwarfs it but more importantly in some
ways is Fox News which I do think is
very important but yeah they they have a
right of siner bias certainly I will
admit that but if you look at how much
Fox News is covering the left fairly
versus the right it&amp;#39;s much more balanced
than like an NBC right like NBC would
never have an interview with Donald J
Trump where the journalist is asking
tough questions but is like sitting down
and broadcasting Donald Trump for an
hour Fox News would do that for kamla
Harris and they did do that for kamla
Harris and there&amp;#39;s a real difference
there well there&amp;#39;s also like the way
Brett Brer uh interviewed bear how bear
the way he interviewed K Harris is very
similar to the way he interviewed Donald
Trump exactly he&amp;#39;s exactly and nobody
accused him of doing anything sneaky
then no or no one was even angry at him
then well because the expectation is
that you&amp;#39;re going to interrupt and
you&amp;#39;re going to fact check and you&amp;#39;re
going to try to actually do the job of
an interviewer but the expectation is
that if you touch kamla with anything
other than kid gloves you know you&amp;#39;re
not allowed to do
that but I think again I think most
people are upset it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons
why the movement is so the movement
towards Trump they&amp;#39;re so enthusiastic
they&amp;#39;re so energetic because they do
realize that there&amp;#39;s this imbalance and
they don&amp;#39;t like it and they they think
that the only way this is going to get
fixed is someone who&amp;#39;s a complete
Outsider and you can&amp;#39;t be more Outsider
than a guy who they&amp;#39;re literally turning
the judicial system against him they&amp;#39;re
literally trying to prosecute him like a
Banana Republic and they&amp;#39;re doing it
over and over and over again and they&amp;#39;re
doing it they&amp;#39;re speaking about it
openly we&amp;#39;re going to put him in jail
we&amp;#39;re going to lock him up and that way
we&amp;#39;re going to keep keep him from being
in the office well you know I I use this
this analogy a couple times publicly but
so what&amp;#39;s interesting to me about
Toddlers and you know I&amp;#39;ve talked with
Tucker Carlson about this toddlers lie
in a way that&amp;#39;s very different from how
everybody else lies right so like if
you&amp;#39;re telling a lie normally you know
hey hey did you do that thing you would
say no no no some you know some somebody
else did it or they kind of qualified a
little bit let me give an example my
4-year-old I&amp;#39;m a big Baker probably
surprised by that but I&amp;#39;m a big Baker
and uh my four-year-old and I are making
an Oreo cake a few weeks ago and I um my
four-year-old is helping me he likes he
likes to help me out a lot when I bake
and I go to the bathroom and the Oreos
that we&amp;#39;re supposed to put in the Oreo
cake like crumble them up and put them
in the cake like half of them are gone
when I get back and I&amp;#39;m like buddy what
happened to the Oreos and he looks at me
and without a hint of irony or shame he
says I didn&amp;#39;t eat the Oreos you
did right so that&amp;#39;s the way that comma
Harris lies is I didn&amp;#39;t need the Oreos
you did not only does she actively brag
and has her Administration actively
bragged about trying to arrest her
political opponents she will go out and
say that if Donald Trump is the
president he&amp;#39;s going to arrest his
political opponents even though he
already was president and he didn&amp;#39;t do
that did you see she went on Shannon
sharp and said that he&amp;#39;s going to take
away your second amendment rights it&amp;#39;s
crazy the person who wants to who
literally wants to confiscate Firearms
KLA Harris is saying that Donald Trump
wants to take away your second amendment
rights dude the the thing that okay do
you know who Steve Bannon is yes okay
fascinating guy didn&amp;#39;t he just get out
he got out of prison yesterday they have
the audacity to say Donald Trump wants
to jail his political opponents Steve
Bannon just got out of prison after a
four-year prison sentence yesterday and
by the way do you know what he was put
in jail for do you know the actual
charge no contempt of congress Eric
Holder who was Obama&amp;#39;s attorney general
was found in contempt of congress or at
least was you know he he there there was
Congress found him in contempt it was
never litigated he was never tried to
put in jail there was no court case
around it the contempt of congress that
Steve Bannon engaged in is that the j6
committee or one of these you know
Banana Republic committees from the
Congressional Democrats they issued him
a subpoena he under the advice of his
lawyer felt that he couldn&amp;#39;t actually
respond to the subpoena because
executive privilege applied they held
him in contempt of congress and they
threw him in prison for it a charge that
has been levied against multiple
Democrats Republicans never tried to
throw anybody in prison against it over
it Steve Bannon just got out of prison
KL Harris is literally using the power
of government has already used the power
of government to jail her political
opponents and she&amp;#39;s saying that Donald
Trump is going to do the thing that he
didn&amp;#39;t do and she did when they were in
respective positions of power do you
think it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re worried that
if he gets into power and he gets back
into the office that he&amp;#39;s going to start
investigating a lot of this stuff and
the the 51 Former Intelligence agents
that&amp;#39;s exactly what they&amp;#39;re afraid of
they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re afraid of consequences
they&amp;#39;re afraid of and look do I think
the 51 intelligence agents who signed
that letter should go to prison no but
should they they be stripped of their
security clearance absolutely I do right
they lied they used their position of
authority and lied to the American
people about something that was in the
National interest if there are no
consequences for that then what are we
doing and they&amp;#39;re probably very
concerned with a trial that&amp;#39;s going to
reveal what the elements of that
particular story really were like oh
there there&amp;#39;s yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot of
corruption there there are I&amp;#39;m sure
higher ups there are people who said one
thing in public but said something else
in private there there probably is at
some level of that whole thing people
who maybe perjured themselves or at
least unethically lied um look there&amp;#39;s a
lot going on there but but you know
Donald Trump is not going out there and
has never said I want to arrest you
because you&amp;#39;re a Democrat he&amp;#39;s never
said I want to arrest you because you
disagree with me he&amp;#39;s never said I want
to censor you even because you engage in
disinformation what he has said is that
we should investigate some of the
obvious sources of corruption in the
United States government that&amp;#39;s not
going after your political opponents
that&amp;#39;s what KL Harris said actually well
one of the things that he&amp;#39;s talked about
pretty openly is that he could have gone
after Hillary Clinton and he didn&amp;#39;t
because he thought it would look bad for
the country and it&amp;#39;s true I mean he
really could have she did Comm crimes
the FBI a Democrat who&amp;#39;s supporting Kam
Hera said that she committed I think not
just crimes but maybe felonies she
committed felonies and what Donald Trump
did is said you know what it&amp;#39;s bad for
the country a lot of my voters would
love me to prosecute Hillary Clinton but
it&amp;#39;s bad for the country so I&amp;#39;m not
going to do it that is the exact
opposite of course of what kamla Harris
and Joe Biden have done and again the
media it&amp;#39;s a total upside down Universe
where they accuse us of doing the very
thing that they&amp;#39;ve done themselves
yeah it&amp;#39;s really wild to watch it&amp;#39;s the
gaslighting is off the charts so there&amp;#39;s
there&amp;#39;s a bunch of things that people
are uh deeply concerned with in this
country uh and it seems like for men
it&amp;#39;s the economy that seems like the
primary thing that people are concerned
with and it seems like for a lot of
women it&amp;#39;s abortion sure abortion and
roie Wade is a big concern yeah now I if
I&amp;#39;m correct your position and this is
what they wanted when they overturned
roie Wade they wanted to leave it in
control of the states is this your
position yeah so what president Trump
has said and what I said is abortion is
now a matter for state legislators State
voters to determine and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
I mean one that&amp;#39;s always what the
argument was right if Row versus Wade
goes away then the state legislator the
state populations are going to make each
individual abortion decision the same
way that like you know California has
different laws on a whole host of
subjects that Alabama does the idea is
that yeah California would make its own
abortion policy Alabama would make its
own abortion policy and I so there&amp;#39;s
there&amp;#39;s a basic sort of principle of
federalism at work there but I also
think that you know knowing Donald Trump
well I think he&amp;#39;s motivated also by
desire for us to just stop having a
culture War over this particular issue
and to let the voters in these states
make these decisions while the national
government focuses on things like
lowering the cost of groceries and
lowering the cost of housing and
securing the southern border and I think
there&amp;#39;s actually some great wisdom in
that because you know think about this
abortion has not really been a political
issue for 50 years now we say that it is
and obviously we disagreed about it and
people thought about it it was always
something that the Supreme Court said
this is the way it is there&amp;#39;s no
political decision-making every European
nation has made abortion policy
democratically and that&amp;#39;s what Donald
Trump is saying do what every European
nation has done let the voters decide
what what their abortion policy is going
to be and we&amp;#39;re going to focus the
national government on on different
things and I I say this as somebody who
you like I I I genuinely you know want
people to choose life and I&amp;#39;m you know a
big believer in families and I think you
know having children has been like a
revelatory experience for me and I want
our country to be more pro- family more
pro- child I think there are all these
things that we can do at the federal
level to make our country more Pro
family and more Pro child you know make
Child Care easier you know stop I&amp;#39;ve
actually sponsored legisl to stop the
surprise medical bills that happen when
people you I&amp;#39;ve seen this with my own
wife you go to the hospital you come
home you&amp;#39;ve got a beautiful baby but
You&amp;#39; also got a $20,000 unexpected bill
because you choose the wrong you know
the wrong outof Network healthc care
provider when you&amp;#39;re at the moment of
delivering a baby like there are all
these things we can do to make it easier
for young women young families to choose
life but Donald Trump I think wants
abortion policy and he said this
explicitly to be decided at the state
level I&amp;#39;m not it it&amp;#39;s not possible for
me to get pregnant so when I think about
these things according to some people
depends on who you ask but I I think
when when you talk you get with the 21st
century man it&amp;#39;s possible for a man to
get pregnant now to Mo for most people I
think one of the issues is or for a lot
of people one of the issues is that men
are making decisions for what women can
can and can&amp;#39;t doar and one of the more
concerning aspects of this is like say
if you live in a state like Texas where
there&amp;#39;s a a limit to when you can get an
abortion I think it&amp;#39;s like six weeks
which a lot of people think at that
point in time you can&amp;#39;t even tell
whether or not you&amp;#39;re pregnant and this
puts a lot of women in like very
vulnerable positions and then there&amp;#39;s
this thought that they could go to
another state where it is legal and have
an abortion but they could be possibly
prosecuted for that in their
state that that&amp;#39;s concerning to me that
we can make if there&amp;#39;s a place in the
country where it&amp;#39;s legal to have medical
procedure and you live in a state where
it&amp;#39;s not legal that your state can
decide what you can and can&amp;#39;t do with
your body which is essentially based on
a religious idea and a lot of the and
I&amp;#39;m not criticizing it one way or
another but I&amp;#39;m saying that a lot of
what this choose life thing is about
that life is precious and life is sacred
and life begins at the moment of
conception and some people agree with
this but other people disagree with this
and it&amp;#39;s seems to be uh a lot of it is
based in religion my concern is using
that to dictate whether or not a person
can legally travel to another state
where I don&amp;#39;t think the government
should be monitoring where you travel or
what you do when you travel as long as
that thing is legal and I&amp;#39;m concerned
with this idea that you could be
prosecuted for it in your state for
doing something that&amp;#39;s legal somewhere
else I don&amp;#39;t like the idea to be clear
I&amp;#39;ve not heard of this maybe as a as
like a possibility but not as something
that actually exists in the in the law
but I&amp;#39;ve not heard of somebody being
arrested and I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of
arresting people for Country I&amp;#39;ve heard
of I&amp;#39;ve heard of the discussion I&amp;#39;ve
heard as a threat that like I don&amp;#39;t like
the idea to be clear of people getting
arrested for freely moving around the
country right I think so so you&amp;#39;re
pointing about it being a religious idea
I mean I would say I know a number of
non-religious people who are very
pro-life and I think the honest answer
is that what we&amp;#39;re doing is we&amp;#39;re trying
to figure out what is the right balance
between autonomy and life I I say this
to somebody who when Ohio made this
decision I campaigned very aggressively
for the more pro-life position in the
state of Ohio and my side lost in fact
we got our assets kicked we we lost 6040
and I I I took some I took some learning
from that I think the one of the things
that I took as a as a as a learning as a
guy who cares about this issue is
Republicans we&amp;#39;ve got to earn the
people&amp;#39;s trust
because they don&amp;#39;t trust the idea that
when we say that we&amp;#39;re pro- family we
don&amp;#39;t just mean Pro birth a lot of
people say you&amp;#39;re Pro birth but you&amp;#39;re
not actually pro- family and I think
there&amp;#39;s a lot that we can do as you know
Republicans to try to earn back the
trust of the American people but if I&amp;#39;m
trying to represent as as fairly as I
can the pro-choice and the pro-life
position here&amp;#39;s what I think is really
going on is you have something now some
people would say maybe religiously
motivated maybe not that it&amp;#39;s a human
life I would say that it&amp;#39;s a human life
but it at least has the potential to be
human life and then on the other hand
you have again I freely recognize this
you have a woman who wants to make a
choice about what she wants to do with
with her own body those are two very
profound values both of which I think
are value are valuable right I mean I
think autonomy is really important I
also think life is really important and
what we&amp;#39;re trying to talk about
fundamentally I think again I&amp;#39;m trying
to be fair to both sides here is to
balance the interest in life against the
interest in autonomy and I think that
the way to do that at least my view is
to let the American people debate and
talk about and argue about this issue
and come to this decision on a
state-by-state basis and again
California Florida Ohio Alabama we&amp;#39;re
going have different solutions to this
particular problem but that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re
trying to do right people like me are
trying to say look I think life really
matters and other people are trying to
say I think autonomy really matters the
truth is that 95% of Americans would
probably say there&amp;#39;s some way to strike
the balance in the middle you know where
most of Europe has ended up here and
it&amp;#39;s actually striking because you think
of Europe again as a more socially
liberal place in America almost every
place in Europe has ended up effectively
where late term abortion outside of
cases of medical necessity is banned
outright and then you know early stage
abortion is allowed that&amp;#39;s how most
societies that democratically settle on
this that&amp;#39;s how they strike the balance
I think my attitude is I&amp;#39;m running for
vice president I&amp;#39;m not trying to tell
you how to strike the right balance but
we want to preserve the right of states
to make these decisions I think what
people are afraid of is men telling
women what they can and can&amp;#39;t do with
their bodies that&amp;#39;s the autonomy value I
get it man I look I I get it and I think
that there there is a very real and
valid argument here that autonomy should
take precedence here but I also think if
we&amp;#39;re being honest there is an argument
that life matters too and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
the balance that people are trying to
it&amp;#39;s very complex and people don&amp;#39;t want
to look at it that way I I always
discuss when I I talk about abortion I
say it&amp;#39;s one of these very human issues
where it&amp;#39;s very strange where most
people think like at the moment of
conception if you could just remove
those cells and keep them from
multiplying that&amp;#39;s less bad than if you
wait six months right like almost
everybody would agree to that so what
are we doing then like what like bill
has a great bit about it you seen b
F and there is a moral intuition there
that obviously like something that looks
and feels like a baby is more valuable
than you know something that&amp;#39;s just
looks heart has a heartbeat sure but but
I you know I think the the it&amp;#39;s just
hard right because it&amp;#39;s not clear to me
philosophically where you draw the line
here um it&amp;#39;s a very like hard question
to figure out and I think that&amp;#39;s why
people debate it and disagree with about
it so vociferously but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
interesting man the the thing that I
find again as a person who leans more in
the pro-life side of this debate is okay
so you will sometimes hear people on the
left say well late term abortion doesn&amp;#39;t
happen well there&amp;#39;s an organization
called the gut mocker Institute it&amp;#39;s a
pro-choice organization it&amp;#39;s a pro you
know abortion rights organization and
they found that there are approximately
I think it&amp;#39;s 12,000 abortions that
happen in the second half of pregnancy
so this is past 20 weeks maybe it&amp;#39;s even
past 22 weeks about 12,000 abortions
past 22 weeks okay they also found that
of those 8,000 of them are purely
elective there&amp;#39;s no medical necessity
there&amp;#39;s no like you know the baby has
some genetic abnormality it&amp;#39;s just pure
elective late term abortion I don&amp;#39;t know
how we can&amp;#39;t get consensus that that is
not good right right come on and in fact
especially when it&amp;#39;s not a medical
necessity exactly every European nation
has gotten to that point where you say
okay like 8,000 late term abortions like
come on but again it&amp;#39;s not my decision
as the vice president or and and that&amp;#39;s
not president Trump&amp;#39;s view he&amp;#39;s very
against a National Abortion ban because
he wants this debate to happen
organically and democratically and I
think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind of our our
attitude to this now you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re right
again there is a balance to strike here
but usually in American society we
recognize that the way to strike that
balance is to debate it as Citizens and
not to have like lawyers and judges make
these determinations for us believe it
or not Joe Biden had one of the most
logical takes on it a long time ago a
long time ago back when he could talk
back when his brain wasn&amp;#39;t fried and he
he said abortion should be safe legal
and rare well that was my grandmother&amp;#39;s
view right that was my grandmother&amp;#39;s
view that was the Bill Clinton view yeah
and I I do think that there&amp;#39;s something
that is really weird about this whole
debate where you know thank God to be
clear this is not true of the gross
majority of our pro-choice citizens but
you do sometimes see people like they&amp;#39;ll
go on Tik tock and they&amp;#39;ll celebrate
having an abortion yeah like I&amp;#39;ve known
many many women usually when I was
younger um who chose to have abortions
because they felt like they didn&amp;#39;t have
any other options and you know I don&amp;#39;t I
don&amp;#39;t judge them I think that a lot of
them just felt like they were completely
trapped and they made the decision that
was ultimately right for them again my
argument is we need to try to gain those
women&amp;#39;s trust back because clearly the
Republican party on this issue has lost
a lot of trust but none of them were
like baking birthday cakes and posting
about it afterwards they recognized that
this is a medical procedure and this is
you know something that they felt they
had to do but celebrating something like
that is just bizarre to me and I I I&amp;#39;m
much more comfortable with the people
who say safe legal rare than I am with
the people who say let&amp;#39;s Shadow abortion
from the rooftops well it&amp;#39;s just this
Rebellion thing you know and it&amp;#39;s also
Rebellion like the the concept in the
Zeitgeist is that abortion had always
been you know Ro roie Wade always been
the law of the land and then all of a
sudden that was taken away and you have
these religious men who are trying to
dictate what women can and can&amp;#39;t do with
their bodies yeah yeah no look I mean
again I I understand that I understand
the the the push back against that but I
I think you can go like with so many
other issues you can go way too far
about it and it becomes trying to
celebrate something that at the very
best if you grant I think every argument
of the pro-choice side it is a neutral
thing not something to be celebrated I
think there&amp;#39;s very few people that are
celebrating though just the
extreme The Tick to it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like
everything right where and I I and I try
you this is something that that is
dangerous about social media is the the
danger of social media with me is not to
me that I live in my own Echo chamber
and just have views reinforced the
danger is that I&amp;#39;m only exposed to the
crazy people on the other side who make
me make it easier for me to adopt my own
worldview because I&amp;#39;m saying oh it&amp;#39;s
just people celebrating when in reality
you know like like you said most
American women even those who are
pro-choice are not celebrating this
thing I think that&amp;#39;s one of the
Insidious things about the social media
algorithm is that it highlights things
that people engage with outrageous which
is more outrageous more things that they
find reprehensible they see more of it I
see so many guys with makeup telling me
they&amp;#39;re going to take your kids
indoctrinate your kids like why I saying
that was because they&amp;#39;re highlighting it
and when you have an app that&amp;#39;s owned by
China that is the number one is that a
coincidence that&amp;#39;s yeah facilitating the
worst of our fellow citizens because it
allows us to Silo more but I I mean the
way that I deal with that is I I just
try as hard as I can to remember that
most Americans This is what really
bothered me about what Biden said like
most Americans who vote for KLA Harris
are fundamentally good people like I I
believe that and you got to try to find
the people who are reasonable and talk
to them and that that&amp;#39;s why I talk about
you know the importance of regaining
trust is just I&amp;#39;ve had enough
conversations with people who don&amp;#39;t like
the Republican parties even their
perception of the Republican party&amp;#39;s
views here that if you talk to
reasonable people you gain a different
perspective than if you talk to the
unreasonable people so I do that I think
a lot of people are only informed by
headlines and by real quick things that
they see on television and so they form
these narratives in their head and this
is what they&amp;#39;re operating off of that&amp;#39;s
absolutely right and this is why they
have this weird perception of both
Republicans and of trump and then they
start throwing these terms around like
fascism and white supremacy and well of
course you don&amp;#39;t like fascism of course
you don&amp;#39;t like white supremacy you can&amp;#39;t
be a Republican and then next thing you
know you&amp;#39;re on the other side and you
don&amp;#39;t like how did you get me you
railroaded me and you guys are
you&amp;#39;re censoring my Facebook what&amp;#39;s
going on here and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s you
know there&amp;#39;s not like a reasonable and
that&amp;#39;s the the the one thing that I
think the Republican party has done
poorly is like be a little bit more
balanced and some of these controversial
social issues you know like the one
thing that people were worried about
right after uh roie Wade was gay
marriage and gay marriage laws and
people were thinking well it&amp;#39;s religion
that overturned roie Wade and religion
is probably goingon to overturn these
May these gay marriage laws and people
are very terrified about that too yeah
and which is which obviously that&amp;#39;s not
something we&amp;#39;re trying to do but it&amp;#39;s
interesting to me that how much people
focus on the religious element of it
because if you go back to the Rover
versus Wade debate you Ruth Bader
Ginsburg who was a feminist icon and was
very pro-choice she thought Ro versus
Wade was terrible law why did you think
that because I mean basically because of
the argument that often you know sort of
Republicans will use about making it a
state issue is she said look you can be
pro-choice as Ruth Bader Ginsburg was
but the avenue to make abortion policy
should be legislatures not judges so it
it was a procedural argument about how
the Constitution functioned where it&amp;#39;s
funny like Ruth Bader Ginsburg actually
agreed with Donald Trump that even if
you know like that this should be a
States issue that the states should make
these decisions among their citizens and
it&amp;#39;s telling that that perspective is
not Illustrated or highlighted but look
I I understand like people who aren&amp;#39;t
you know I&amp;#39;m obviously a person of Faith
they don&amp;#39;t want people of Faith to force
their values down people who don&amp;#39;t agree
with them but I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sort of
comfortable with EV every one of us kind
of having our our Zone and within that
zone I don&amp;#39;t want people to come in and
tell me what to do like in my home I&amp;#39;d
like to be able to raise my kids with my
religious values and I&amp;#39;d like to be able
to teach my kids what I think and you
should be able to teach your kids what
you think and then we recognize that the
more public The Zone the less that I can
get to control what you do and that&amp;#39;s
part of living in a pluralistic society
and I&amp;#39;m very comfortable with that I
think unfortunately the modern left
seems to be less and less comfortable
even with people of Faith having their
own private zone right this is the trans
thing where it&amp;#39;s like oh we&amp;#39;re going to
take your kids away if you don&amp;#39;t consent
to gender reassignment or you know we&amp;#39;re
going to tell you that you can&amp;#39;t send
your kids to a religious school you hear
people say these things again I think
it&amp;#39;s the crazies it&amp;#39;s not the majority
of our fellow citizens but part of
living in a pluralistic society is
accepting that every man&amp;#39;s Castle or
every woman&amp;#39;s Castle is his or her own
you&amp;#39;ve got to have respect for people
within those castles and then we should
hopefully just have some common sense
things that everybody can agree on when
we&amp;#39;re talking about public spaces I
think for a lot of people worst case
scenario when they start thinking about
religious influence
on the way they&amp;#39;re allowed to behave and
the the way their state is governed
worst case scenario is a state adopts
Sharia
law this is worst case scenario and I
think all these people that would cry
against the concept of islamophobia yeah
really need to understand what that
means and what you&amp;#39;re talking about and
to say that that&amp;#39;s an outrageous and
ridiculous idea that&amp;#39;s never going to
take place it&amp;#39;s kind of already worked
its way into some societies it has it
has and there are is it is it Minnesota
that has called to prayer like is it
Minneapolis I I don&amp;#39;t know where I know
there is there is a place in Minnesota I
believe where they have prayer calls as
a matter of local government I do think
that&amp;#39;s I do think that&amp;#39;s happening that
starts getting real weird yeah stuff
like that starts getting real weird and
when you have people that are openly
saying our goal is and they&amp;#39;ve talked
about this in Toronto like activists
have said our goal is to outbreed
everyone who is not Muslim and vote it
out and and put Sharia law in place yeah
that&amp;#39;s very scary women have to wear
burkas this is how it works yeah well
and that&amp;#39;s I mean that&amp;#39;s what to me is
so crazy about some of the hyper
leftwing reaction to you know the idea
that like somehow I want to force every
man woman and child to go to my church
is ridiculous I just don&amp;#39;t want to do
that I&amp;#39;ve never had any interest in
doing that um but where you see actual
real religious tyranny is increasingly
in Western societies where you&amp;#39;ve had a
large influx of immigrants who don&amp;#39;t
necessarily assimilate into Western
values but try to create I think a
religious tyranny at the local level and
if you think that won&amp;#39;t happen at a
national level you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re crazy did
you ever read Douglas Murray&amp;#39;s book uh
the Str strange death of Europe um I
haven&amp;#39;t read the whole thing but i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve
read it in bits and pieces he&amp;#39;s a smart
guy he got attacked so hard for that
because he was really like an early
Sounder he&amp;#39;s the power R of this
well no dude one of the most
controversial things I&amp;#39;ve ever said is
what is the first islamist right CU it&amp;#39;s
important to separate there are Muslims
who are not islamists right islamists
are like theocrats right right what is
the first islamist country that is going
to have a nuclear weapon and sort of
joked I said maybe it&amp;#39;s going to be the
United Kingdom because they&amp;#39;re so bad at
assimilating sort of newer immigrants
into their society you have definitely
communities in the UK where local
leaders are running explicitly on Sharia
law and winning elections in cities that
are in the United Kingdom right this is
England this is like where America came
from right there&amp;#39;s a bunch of English uh
pilgrims who came to to to the United
States that to me is really crazy and
really scary and then of course
everybody said well you know Pakistan
already has nuclear weapons and my
response is well Pakistan isn&amp;#39;t
necessarily an islamist country it&amp;#39;s an
Islamic country they certainly have an
Islamic government and that&amp;#39;s the
majority religion of the people but
Pakistan isn&amp;#39;t going and saying we need
to like conquer the infidels at least
their government isn&amp;#39;t we need to coner
conquer the infidels and force them to
obey our laws you see that more in among
some of the activists in the United
Kingdom om maybe than you do in in in
certain Arab countries and that&amp;#39;s crazy
it is crazy but it it goes along with
this thing that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about
I think essentially people have sort of
a buil-in mode a program in their mind
that accepts religious doctrines and
these religious doctrines could be woke
it could be you know hardcore right-wing
Conservative Christian fundamentalism or
it could be Islamic Doctrine but we yeah
but this is why assimilation is so
important right is that look I&amp;#39;m married
to the daughter of immigrants I do think
that immigration can enrich this country
I do think that you know immigrants many
of them are bringing a lot of to the
table but we have to be honest with
ourselves that permitting 500,000
immigrants in a society like ours is
much different than permitting 5 million
or 50 million immigrants and importantly
where are the immigrants coming from
what are their values what are their
economic skills there&amp;#39;s something what&amp;#39;s
their criminal record what&amp;#39;s their
criminal record there&amp;#39;s something very
in in in sort of the modern again this
is a new thing because this is not Bill
Clinton liberalism this is something
that we&amp;#39;re seeing today where they don&amp;#39;t
even want to talk about the quality and
the backgrounds and the skills of people
coming to our country somehow it&amp;#39;s
fundamentally racist to say well we
don&amp;#39;t want certain people of certain
backgrounds to be in the United States
of America no it&amp;#39;s just common sense I
mean let let me sort of give you a very
specific example okay so you know ask
yourself should America accept 100,000
immigrants from Mexico okay just in the
abstract well Mexico is a gigantic
country with Millions upon millions of
people who are we talking about are we
talking about people who speak English
as a second language and don&amp;#39;t have
criminal backgrounds or are we talking
about people who don&amp;#39;t even read and
write in Spanish and do have criminal
background grounds cuz those same groups
of people even though they come from the
country we call Mexico are going to
assimilate and contribute to America&amp;#39;s
Society much differently there&amp;#39;s
something in the modern liberal mind
that doesn&amp;#39;t even allow you to ask the
question who does America benefit from
bringing into this country and if the
answer is we don&amp;#39;t benefit then why
would we bring them into the country
well it&amp;#39;s also this the concept of being
anti-open border somehow or another
became attached instead to of safety it
became attached to xenophobia it became
attached to racism and when you know you
confront people and say do you know that
Venezuela is literally opening their
prisons and instructing people to just
cross into America like no when you tell
the one of the wildest ones I think it
was you were having a conversation with
a woman we were discussing the gangs in
Aurora Colorado that have taken yeah and
she was like it&amp;#39;s only a couple
buildings and imagine that&amp;#39;s your your
community it&amp;#39;s only a couple of
apartment complexes right with hundreds
of people that have been taken over by
Venezuelan gangs I I I think Joe the
right number apartment complexes taken
over by Venezuelan gangs is zero it&amp;#39;s in
San Antonio too it&amp;#39;s happening in San
Antonio it&amp;#39;s happening everywhere it&amp;#39;s
so crazy that people don&amp;#39;t want to admit
to this because if they do it&amp;#39;s
empowering the right and they think it&amp;#39;s
going to help Donald Trump get elected
so they&amp;#39;re turning a blind eye to
dangerous criminals crossing the border
with no recurse no tracking you can&amp;#39;t do
anything about it well you see this in
some communities where because they&amp;#39;re
small towns and because rapid migrant
influx can happen very quickly where the
town population has been doubled okay so
you don&amp;#39;t even have to assume people are
criminals what does it do to the local
public school when all of a sudden a
thousand newcomers show up that don&amp;#39;t
even speak English right what does it do
to the hospital system when you now have
thousands of people in a small Health
Care system that are showing up to get
emergency servic
because they don&amp;#39;t have access otherwise
to a doctor and now the American
citizens have to wait in line for 7
hours to get to see a doctor because
we&amp;#39;ve overwhelmed the local hospital
system what does it do to housing prices
we&amp;#39;ve seen this in a number of
communities including those that I
represent in Ohio when you bring in
thousands upon thousands of people you
cannot build enough houses quickly
enough to accommodate that so the cost
of housing becomes unaffordable for
American citizens it is the craziest
thing that we&amp;#39;ve seen in this country
that you don&amp;#39;t even allow people to talk
about the effects of mass migration
anymore and that&amp;#39;s why I think it&amp;#39;s one
of the reasons why Donald Trump is going
to be elected president or at least
should be elected president because he&amp;#39;s
one of the few guys who&amp;#39;s saying you
know what no no no we&amp;#39;re going to talk
about this problem yes some immigrants
are good some immigrants are not good
and that is an obvious insight to
anybody who knows human nature what do
you think is the goal behind allowing
this to take place now first of all one
of the things that KLA Harris has said
was that there was a bill that could
have fixed the Border problem but that
Donald Trump did not want it to take
place because he wanted to keep this as
a political talking point totally
dishonest totally dishonest what was the
bill okay here was the bill what
happened is okay let me talk about what
the bill does first of all okay number
one is it sets a maximum cap on the
number of illegal immigrants that we can
have before the Border shuts down that
maximum cap is 2 million illegal aliens
per year it&amp;#39;s like 1.85 million to be
more precise that&amp;#39;s number one it did
number two it codified what&amp;#39;s called
Catch and Release where a person comes
into our country they&amp;#39;re an illegal
immigrant but they say no no no I&amp;#39;m not
an illegal immigrant I&amp;#39;m an asylum
seeker and so their claim for Asylum
gets adjudicated but because there&amp;#39;s a
backlog because we have so many there
their their claim isn&amp;#39;t going to be
adjudicated for 15 years so rather than
having that person wait in Mexico we
give them a work permit and we give them
legal status and we let them come into
the United States States of America
that&amp;#39;s called Catch and Release Donald
Trump&amp;#39;s policy was you have to wait in
Mexico we&amp;#39;re not going to catch you and
then release you into the country for 15
years it codified that in other words
even if Donald Trump became president
and this is why he really hated it is
that he would not be able to undo Catch
and Release if he won the election it
would be codified into American law
third thing it did nothing on the border
wall nothing on an immigration system
called parole which is supposed to be a
case by case you grant parole to people
people who are fleeing tyranny but
Harris has used parole to the tune of
millions upon Millions Mass parole whole
categories of country have been paroled
into the United States it didn&amp;#39;t do
anything to solve that problem so it
wasn&amp;#39;t a border security bill it was an
amnesty bill now in addition to what I
just said it also gave some table scraps
to border patrol that and that that is
what allows them to hinge onto that one
thing and to say it&amp;#39;s a border it&amp;#39;s a
border security Bill no no no no no it
was a mass amnesty bill would have made
the Border problem 10 times worse and
that&amp;#39;s why they ultimately uh pushed it
and that&amp;#39;s why Republicans fought
against it by the way like six Democrats
uh voted against that piece of
legislation because they thought it was
kind of a disaster so it was not a
bipartisan border Bill and in fact it
was much more bipartisan the opposition
to the legislation but it has allowed
kamla Harris to go around and
dishonestly claim that she cares about
the southern border even though when she
came into office they bragged about
undoing all of Donald Trump&amp;#39;s successful
border policies they did exactly that
and then we had the massive migrant
Invasion that we&amp;#39;ve seen over the last
three years and I think it was good on
you in the debate with Tim Waltz when
they fact checked you they tried to fact
you check you and say that this has
always been in place and you stepped up
and said no no no this app is new and
this app was specifically used for
shipping yes and now they&amp;#39;re using it to
schedule people to illegally come come
into the country so but here&amp;#39;s the
question why why is this happening what
do you think I mean obviously
speculation a little bit but what do you
think the motivation of allowing this to
take place and the disproportionate
number of people that have moved to
swing states which is also like a little
suspicious um so depends on how many how
many tinf foil hats do you have in this
room dude I got a wardrobe we can get
real serious about this real quick or
pretty pretty crazy very quickly look I
think what is obvious is and I&amp;#39;ve seen
this in the halls of Congress I&amp;#39;ve seen
it very explicitly you talk about
lobbying and we obviously talked about
the context of other Industries there is
a massive corporate Lobby for cheap
labor in the United States of America
and that is I think the main thing
that&amp;#39;s going on think about this if
you&amp;#39;ve got millions of illegal aliens
okay let me tell you a story in 2017
2018 when I was in the private sector I
was at a a business conference dinner
and I was seated next to the CEO of one
of the largest hotel chains in America
this is I think probably 2018 and the
guy is going on and on about how much he
hates Donald Trump and I&amp;#39;m like oh
that&amp;#39;s interesting like why do you hate
Donald Trump so much cuz again I was I
was sort of a trump skeptic in 2015 and
at this point I was kind of you know
starting to really get get on the Trump
train and he said well the reason as I
the reason I hate Donald Trump he says
is because Donald Trump&amp;#39;s border
policies have cut down the number of
illegal immigrants and because I can&amp;#39;t
pay illegal immigrants under the table
anymore I have to pay American workers
and they want much higher wages and I
was like this guy just admitted it I was
like holy this guy just aded
that is like straight up
Monopoly man evil that this guy
admitted to and I was like you know my
my wife who&amp;#39;s very apolitical she was
actually at the dinner with me and she&amp;#39;s
like come again you just said you don&amp;#39;t
want Americans to get decent wages like
that is the best argument for Donald
Trump&amp;#39;s immigration policy is that
American workers are getting higher
wages and this is why this corporate CEO
hates it so whatever the industry is
you&amp;#39;ve got a lot of people who want
cheap labor and they don&amp;#39;t want to pay
American workers higher wages that&amp;#39;s a
big part of it I do think there&amp;#39;s also a
power Dynamic to it in particular I
think kamla Harris and the Democrats
they want to give these millions upon
millions of illegal aliens the right to
vote they want to legalize them they
want to make it easier for them to
participate in our elections and that
means fundamentally the end of American
democracy because you&amp;#39;re talking about
25 million people here if KLA Harris
gives 10 million of those people legal
status and allows them to vote in
American elections then you know say say
say 7030 they go Democrat Republicans
will never win a national election in
this country in my
lifetime and the only way to get them on
your side was be would be the
Republicans offer the same services and
maybe even be more generous in letting
illegals in exactly I mean You&amp;#39; have to
literally beat them at their own game
like I&amp;#39;m going to give you a free house
yeah no I mean yeah you know lifetime is
probably overstating it but you&amp;#39;d have
to it would take 30 years for the
Republic
to get to a point where we could even
compete with these these newcomers but
again it will have degraded the voting
power of the people who have the legal
right to be here and States blue forever
the same way they&amp;#39;ve done California
exactly and we saw this and look I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m
like a Reagan guy right I&amp;#39;m a
Conservative Republican um but Reagan
screwed up a lot he screwed up mental
health in this country people don&amp;#39;t talk
nearly enough about that the amnesty
thing he really screwed up amnesty thing
he really screwed up and people always
say well you know Ronald Reagan you know
when they CR of of Donald Trump will say
well look at how Reagan talked about
immigration because of what Ronald
Reagan did at the 1986 amnesty
California is now effectively a
permanently Blue State except when
Arnold won but Arnold ran as a super
moderate Republican he was a major
celebrity right he was at the height of
his celebrity power and he still he
still won barely even though California
had been
mismanaged California is a one party
State because of Ronald Reagan&amp;#39;s amnesty
and that&amp;#39;s the fear is that the entire
country could become one part the entire
country becomes that now it also you may
not appreciate this but even if you
don&amp;#39;t give people the right to vote it
really distorts Congressional
apportionment and then the Electoral
College you know how this works yes I do
but explain it to people please okay so
how many you know we have 435
congressional seats who the way that you
draw those congressional districts is
that you try to draw them evenly based
on population so that everybody has
equal representation right one person
one vote fundamental principle of
American law but you don&amp;#39;t just count
the American citizens you also count the
illegal aliens and so for example the
state of Ohio lost a congressional seat
in the last census and states that have
high illegal immigrant populations
picked up congressional seats so you&amp;#39;re
actually taking away congressional
representation from American citizens
and giving it to illegal aliens even if
you don&amp;#39;t give them the right to vote
you&amp;#39;re still destroying the voting power
of American citizens because it&amp;#39;s based
on population because it&amp;#39;s based on
population including illegal immigrants
is there a way to change it so that it&amp;#39;s
only based on legal American citizens
well Donald Trump tried a proposal that
Democrats went nuts over and litigated
was litigated in the courts so we would
have to try again that would ask
citizenship status during the US Census
the idea being that if you ask more
people their citizenship status you get
fewer people who are answering that
question I think that we should make it
and I and I do think this this would
require an of Congress but I think that
it would be constitutional is we should
just say that illegal aliens are not
counted for purposes of congressional
representation yeah I mean Democrats
would call that racist but it&amp;#39;s just
common sense policy well especially if
it&amp;#39;s been shown that you&amp;#39;re manipulating
it by moving more people to these places
and even if they&amp;#39;re not legal citizens
and they can&amp;#39;t vote it still counts as
congressional seats correct that&amp;#39;s kind
of crazy that&amp;#39;s exactly right it doesn&amp;#39;t
I the the one that drives me the most
crazy is this idea a that somehow or
another uh it&amp;#39;s discriminatory to
require ID to vote nuts that could only
me I&amp;#39;ve tried to look at this from the
most charitable position outside of it
only makes sense if you&amp;#39;re trying to
cheat that&amp;#39;s exactly right this you need
an ID for everything you need an ID to
rent a car well you know it&amp;#39;s basically
illegal now in California to ask for
voter ID which is crazy which is totally
insane but you know my my my view and I
I&amp;#39;m sure you got many many listeners in
the great state of California the next
time you&amp;#39;re pulled over by a police
officer just tell them that you&amp;#39;re on
your way to vote I&amp;#39;ve seen that me I
mean think about this but you you can&amp;#39;t
if you can&amp;#39;t require people to show
voter ID then I think you&amp;#39;re inviting
fraud into your system and there&amp;#39;s also
something implicitly very racist about
this because what they say is voter ID
means that black people aren&amp;#39;t going to
vote well number one if you look at
polls the same level of support for
voter ID exists in the black community
is in the white Community it&amp;#39;s about 75
80% of blacks 75 80% of whites support
voter ID but they&amp;#39;re basically saying
that black people can&amp;#39;t get
identification when they say that voter
ID is racist they&amp;#39;re implicitly saying
black people can&amp;#39;t get identification I
think that&amp;#39;s an actual racist concept
concept I actually assume that my fellow
or or or the black citizens are my
fellow Americans and they can do the
same thing that every other citizen can
do which is good identification yeah
it&amp;#39;s fundamentally just gaslighting it&amp;#39;s
yeah that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s all it is it&amp;#39;s
just you&amp;#39;re trying hard to make your
point because you want people to be able
to vote that maybe shouldn&amp;#39;t be voting
and then there&amp;#39;s all these lawsuits
where they&amp;#39;re counting votes that they
know to be illegitimate well they&amp;#39;re
saying that there&amp;#39;s a certain amount of
people that are in the system that
they&amp;#39;re going to they want to keep in
there yeah which is crazy so you&amp;#39;re
saying you want people that shouldn&amp;#39;t be
allowed to vote to vote no they say that
they don&amp;#39;t want illegal aliens or
illegal voters to vote the Harris
Administration right now is litigating a
law suit against the governor of
Virginia because the governor of
Virginia using a state law kicked about
1,500 people or maybe 6,500 but it was
it was some some number of people off
the Virginia voter roles because they
checked a box that said they were
non-citizen well if you&amp;#39;re non-citizen
you can&amp;#39;t be on the voter roles so he
kicked all of the non-citizens off the
voter roles Harris is suing Glenn yunan
the the department of justice under
kamla Harris is suing him to ensure that
those voters go back on the V rules
there&amp;#39;s no argument any sense there&amp;#39;s no
argument for this other than you want to
facilitate cheating but the fact that
the left has no problem with this
because they just want to win is insane
but who&amp;#39;s going to hold their feet to
the fire who&amp;#39;s going to tell the honest
truth the American Media has barely even
covered the fact that in the middle of a
very consequential presidental
presidential election kamla Harris&amp;#39;s
Department of Justice is suing to keep
illegal voters on the voter
roles it&amp;#39;s crazy it&amp;#39;s wild so it&amp;#39;s like
for Trump to win he has to win by an
enormous margin he has to overcome a lot
of this Shenanigans well as president
Trump says we want to make it too big to
rig uh I I I look I encourage all of
your listeners whether you agree with us
on all the issues or not if you agree
with censorship then vote kamla Harris
and if you think Americans should be
able to say what they want to say then
get out there and vote vote early vote
by mail like that&amp;#39;s obviously part of
the reason why I&amp;#39;m here is I want to get
people out there to vote because I do
think that we need to overwhelm the
system with so many voters that we
ensure that we get the representative
government that we actually deserve as a
country and that&amp;#39;s not going to happen
unless people get out there and vote is
one of the things that I think is an
important issue that kind of gets put
aside is I know a lot of veterans in
particular and a lot of people with uh
some severe trauma that have had uh
psychedelic therapy and they&amp;#39;ve had to
go to other countries to do it they&amp;#39;ve
they&amp;#39;ve done some of it illegally in
America but I know far too many guys who
have had PTSD who have had an incredible
experience and been alleviated of all
these and this helped them the helped
them tremendously what is it is it like
MDMA or is it what MDMA was what Maps
was using they were running these
studies and they got they they got close
to FDA approval but then now they&amp;#39;re
being sent back to say they have to do
more studies the problem is like you
can&amp;#39;t really do blind Placebo controled
studies on MDMA either you&amp;#39;re on it or
you&amp;#39;re not on it it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious you
know yeah sugar pills don&amp;#39;t have the
same effects yeah it just doesn&amp;#39;t but
the therapy for people that are
suffering from severe PTSD has been
incredibly beneficial they&amp;#39;ve shown that
with the map studies but they&amp;#39;ve also
shown it with like anecdotally I know a
bunch of different guys that have gone
down to Mexico and had psilocybin
Journeys and all these different things
where they&amp;#39;ve
encountered these experience es that
have made them sort of rethink who they
are alleviated them of a lot of the
stress and a lot of the the the trauma
that they&amp;#39;ve experienced and given them
peace and the the the the concept of
schedule one is that there&amp;#39;s no medical
benefit right and if these people are
experiencing first of all C cessation of
smoking people that have had issues with
addiction I beain treatments another one
that they&amp;#39;ve found which is not
something that anyone would ever abuse
recreationally I&amp;#39;ve never done on it but
apparently it&amp;#39;s an excruciating
experience but the uh rate of curing
addiction is tremendous from it and
these things have been denied uh a
people have had denied access to it
because of this scheduling issue huh
like there&amp;#39;s a like we we discussed it
yesterday on the podcast like the ld50
rate was like lethal dose at 50% is
impossible to achieve with silin and yet
it&amp;#39;s still illegal and that there&amp;#39;s all
these people that have reported Sid
mushrooms right yes okay and you know
but you can synthesize it it doesn&amp;#39;t
have to be I see but
the the scheduling of these things in
particularly like marijuana like
marijuana is legal on a state level with
I think almost half the country now if
not more yeah but yet federally illegal
and if you go to the history of why it
was federally illegal in the first place
it coincides with the U what happened
with prohibition of alcohol right after
prohibition of alcohol they turned their
eyes to marijuana and there was a lot of
political influence by Harry anslinger
and William Randolph Hurst and there&amp;#39;s a
lot of maneuvering and that&amp;#39;s where the
reform Madness films came up and all
this propaganda stuff it was to make it
illegal essentially to to make the
textile the the hemp
illegal interesting okay there&amp;#39;s a long
history to it we can get it&amp;#39;s basically
more about the commodity of hemp that it
was really about the drug itself in fact
the the term marijuana was never used
for cannabis which has been used for
thousands and thousands of years the
term marijuana was created by William
Randol Hurst and put in Hurst newspapers
it was originally marijuana was a
Mexican slang word for a wild tobacco
really it had nothing so they started
writing these stories about blacks and
Mexicans smoking this new drug marijuana
and raping white women and most of this
was I had no idea this history it&amp;#39;s so
crazy the story is so nuts but it all
came about because of a uh an invention
called the decorticator and the
decorticator is uh it&amp;#39;s an invention
that allows them to economically and
effectively process hemp fiber without
slave labor so when the cotton gin came
along people stopped using hemp as much
because it&amp;#39;s much more difficult to work
with and they started using cotton for
clothing but before that they&amp;#39; use hemp
and this is nonpsychoactive hemp yeah it
makes a superior paper it does there&amp;#39;s
there&amp;#39;s a bunch of uses for it
completely outside of the active aspect
of it William Rand there was the cover
of was it Popular Science magazine
Popular Mechanics magazine hemp the new
billion doll crop and it was all about
this invention so then the propaganda
machine goes into full scale and then
they start this was in the 1930s okay so
they start here it is the new billion
doll crop 1938 and this is because of
this invention the
decorticator so solves a problem you can
see it there solves a problem more than
6,000 years old hemp a crop that would
not compete with other American products
and instead it will displace Imports of
raw material and manufactured products
produced by underpaid coie and peasant
labor provide thousands of jobs for
American workers throughout the land so
everybody was really high on hemp as a
commodity because of this new machine
that you could process hemp fiber with
where you can make much more Superior
paper Superior clothing like it&amp;#39;s like
canvas literally the mon Lisa was
painted on hemp the first draft the
Declaration of Independence was written
on hemp they used to use it for paper
back then so then brandol Hurst who owns
Hurst publication and also owns all
these paper mills and forests filled
with trees okay so they go back to the
financial exactly and so we&amp;#39;re still
trapped under this propaganda that was
distributed in the 1930s by incredibly
powerful people yeah and this is why
it&amp;#39;s illegal on the federal level and
even though you have medical marijuana
that&amp;#39;s been showed to help people with
chemotherapy and wasting disease help
people that have appetite problem and
people in chronic pain it&amp;#39;s still listed
as a schedule run drug federally which
to me is unconscionable it doesn&amp;#39;t make
any sense okay so like first of all
we&amp;#39;re not trying to be clear because I&amp;#39;m
speaking as a vice presidental candidate
we&amp;#39;re not trying to throw people in jail
for smoking weed that&amp;#39;s like very much
Something That We&amp;#39;re Not Just in doing
um what is I mean the one thing that I
have like my attitude on this stuff is
kind of Live and Let Live Like keep it
in your home I don&amp;#39;t like smelling it
when I take my kids to the park right
keep Dy what&amp;#39;s that yeah exactly um but
like you know keep it at home I don&amp;#39;t
want to throw people in prison that&amp;#39;s
not what we&amp;#39;re trying to do I don&amp;#39;t
think you should be drunk at the park
either right exactly exactly same same
exact principle the the the thing that I
wonder about is if you you know I I I do
there&amp;#39;s a part of me that worries a
little bit about kids doing a lot of
this stuff and I wonder you know to your
point about consent and the brains
development and all these things really
worry about do you have an increase in
usage among minors and so what I&amp;#39;d like
to get is is some sort of legal regime
that you know again it&amp;#39;s not like
criminally Prosecuting or Prosecuting at
all people for smoking a joint but also
where we can actually ensure that it&amp;#39;s
kept out of public spaces that&amp;#39;s kind of
my attitude towards it and I think
that&amp;#39;s the right the right approach I
mean on the Psychedelic thing what is
like what would need to be
done cuz I I know to be clear I know
absolutely nothing about this so this is
me you know asking a question not
committing to some public policy you had
to be careful with this stuff especially
six days from an election but I had
never heard about you know because I&amp;#39;m a
veteran too I served four years in the
united Marine Corps went to Iraq uh went
to Haiti once and is there any
like like what is the pathway I guess or
what do you think should happen for
veterans accessing psychedelics well
there&amp;#39;s so many anecdotal stories about
veterans experiencing relief that I
think think it should be available to
them uh especially veterans I think that
we put our veterans through but is it
like an FDA thing as making it possible
for them to get the therapy okay yes and
it&amp;#39;s also the way it&amp;#39;s scheduled you
know it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s schedule one
isn&amp;#39;t it but like like if it had a
medical use presly you would get it off
of schedule one yes so why aren&amp;#39;t we and
I&amp;#39;m just fascinated by this this is the
first time I&amp;#39;ve heard about this why
aren&amp;#39;t we testing whether there is yeah
Fair Point you can&amp;#39;t do a double blind
placebo controlled study but you can
definitely still study whether this
helps people or not why aren&amp;#39;t we doing
that or are we doing that I&amp;#39;m just not
aware of it well we&amp;#39;re definitely not
doing it I mean there&amp;#39;s been some
research John Hopkins did some research
on psychedelics and theyve found similar
benefits there&amp;#39;s also dangers like uh
any anything that has profound effects
on the human mind there&amp;#39;s certain people
that are very vulnerable and those
people should not be taking these things
there&amp;#39;s people that have a hard time
with regular reality you know they&amp;#39;re
barely hanging on regularly yeah and but
I think the people that are not should
have access to that because I believe in
Freedom and I and I believe in the
freedom to explore things that have
great benefits and I keep going back to
Veterans because I think we require an
insane thing of them we take regular
people who live in civilized society we
send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq
and have them engaged in the absolutely
most brutal thing that people do which
is war they see their friends blown
apart they get shot they see people die
they have to kill people and then they
come back here and then they&amp;#39;re supposed
to just acclimate Y and there&amp;#39;s no
guidelines there&amp;#39;s no way to do it
there&amp;#39;s no no one can coach you through
it and a lot of these guys wind up
killing themselves and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very
high amount and you know Shawn Ryan you
have you done his show yeah love Shan
Ryan Love Shawn Ryan Shawn Ryan was
talking about the experience that it had
with him completely changed his life he
stopped drinking he became a much more
compassionate sensitive person we talked
about like foreign policy and and
Veteran stuff but we didn&amp;#39;t talk about
this that&amp;#39;s the guy&amp;#39;s in Navy SEAL I
mean he&amp;#39;s seen a lot of he&amp;#39;s seen a
lot of right I mean it&amp;#39;s just
that&amp;#39;s the job and you come back over
here and you&amp;#39;re supposed to just be
normal and there&amp;#39;s no help at least for
those people I know like look I my
attitude is we should help veterans get
the mental health they need meal mental
health treatment they need and be less
screwed up by all this stuff we should
be doing whatever we can I guess I just
don&amp;#39;t understand why aren&amp;#39;t we like is
this a Pharma lobbying thing is this a
bureaucratic screwed up thing like
because I&amp;#39;m always wondering like what
what why are we not actually solving
problems and this is a problem I know
nothing about sorry I know a lot about
veteran suicides and Veteran mental
health this this proposed solution like
literally the first time you get real
cynical as to what&amp;#39;s the resistance you
could say the companies that make
psychotropic drugs uh ssris and the like
and companies that have a vested
interest in continuing to sell these
things would not want something that
causes people to have a profound
psychological change that doesn&amp;#39;t
require them to be on these things
anymore there could be an impact in that
but I think there&amp;#39;s also a lot of
ignorance yeah have you read this book
bad therapy no okay it&amp;#39;s good I&amp;#39;ve heard
it&amp;#39;s good yeah I haven&amp;#39;t heard it though
so the mental health thing in the United
States is really really worrisome
because you know when I when I talk
about obviously we have a big gun
violence problem you unit States of
America and I talk about mental health
because obviously that&amp;#39;s a part of
what&amp;#39;s going on here it&amp;#39;s what they say
is well every other country has mental
health meaning Advocates of strict gun
laws say every other country has mental
health problems but they don&amp;#39;t have the
same gun violence problem that we do
it&amp;#39;s actually not totally true if you
look at like SSRI prescriptions uh
selective serotonin and reuptake
Inhibitors it&amp;#39;s like Prozac that
category of mental health Therapeutics
we take something like six times as much
as are peer countries economically so
clearly there&amp;#39;s something with mental
health treatment in the United States
that is very very broken there&amp;#39;s also a
direct correlation between School
shooters Mass Shooters and ssris really
yeah oh yeah like most of the people
that have com that have committed mass
shootings and not talking about gang
shootings but a bunch of them are on
psychotropic drugs and everybody wants
to blame drugs oh yeah Google it because
you you can find out what the numbers I
know Coline kids were on psychotropic
drugs I know there&amp;#39;s been a ton of
School shooters prescribed talking about
weed no no no prescribed psychotropic
drugs prescribed psych psychiatric drugs
and that if you bring that up you are
taking away from the this argument they
want to say where they want to blame
everything on the guns it&amp;#39;s all about
gun control and we need more gun control
like the gun is a tool there&amp;#39;s more guns
in this country than there are human
beings okay I I made this I made this
argument out the debate the the idea
that you can gun regulate your way out
of this problem is ridiculous because
ridicul we have so many firearms in the
United States of America that even if I
bought into the gun control argument
you&amp;#39;re never going to be able to get
sufficient guns off the streets so it&amp;#39;s
ridiculous so we have we have to
actually go after some of the root
causes here it also ignores me like
Finland for example has a lot of guns
does not have nearly the same problem
with these Mass shooters that we do I&amp;#39;d
be interested to see what their their um
mental health drug usage rate is too did
you ever see Ted nent debate Pierce
Morgan on gun violence no I never did I
pretty good it&amp;#39;s really good Ted smart
guy he&amp;#39;s a very smart guy but Ted
actually knows the statistics so when
Pierce was bringing up all the mass
shootings and all the gun violence
shootings Ted said do you know what they
really are do you know how many of them
are suicide side do you know how many of
them are gang violence do you know how
many of them are cop shooting bad guys
do you know how many of them are
actually Mass Shooters yeah yeah I did
know that actually that Mo when we talk
about gun violence problem what we&amp;#39;re
really talking about primarily is gang
violence yes right that&amp;#39;s where that&amp;#39;s
where a lot of the gun violence I think
a majority of the gun violence is coming
from which is not to say it&amp;#39;s not a
problem but it&amp;#39;s not the same problem
that obviously gathers most of the
headlines right and idea that just
getting guns out of people&amp;#39;s hands you
got a bail we&amp;#39;re good I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m good if
you are the guy yeah the idea that
you&amp;#39;re going to take guns away from
everyone you&amp;#39;re going to solve the
problem it&amp;#39;s like no you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re still
going to have people that are out of
their mind and they want to commit
violence and they&amp;#39;re going to find
another way to do it like we we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve
had other ways that people have killed a
lot of people because they were sick
yeah because they&amp;#39;re out of their mind
that&amp;#39;s right and the fact that no one
wants to look at this connection between
psychiatric drugs and mass shootings is
kind of insane have you have you found
anything that shows like the data on
that&amp;#39;s pretty wild I&amp;#39;m finding people
saying that there no link no proof
there&amp;#39;s a paper that says so I&amp;#39;m trying
to find so that time is that&amp;#39;s Central
Time right it&amp;#39;s 12:19 right now we&amp;#39;ve
probably got like 15 20 more minutes cuz
I have to do this event with tulsy in
Pennsylvania so um when is this going to
air but oh sorry tomorrow tomorrow great
or today okay today tonight fantastic um
anyway so yeah what are you doing with
Tulsi uh we&amp;#39;re doing veterans Town Hall
as a matter of fact at uh I think we&amp;#39;re
doing Western PA but I need to check I
don&amp;#39;t know where I&amp;#39;m going from day to
day but um yeah she obviously cares a
lot about veterans issues and you know
the most important veterans issue is
yeah the mental health thing really
matters but it&amp;#39;s that we shouldn&amp;#39;t be
sending them to stupid Wars well that
was one of the most insane things that
Hillary Clinton did when she tried to
say that she was a Russian
agent like that was so much man
I is so crazy this woman so czy overseas
twice she was a congresswoman for eight
years and decided to call her Russi
Russian agent Hillary Clinton by the way
who&amp;#39;s not served in the military at all
and who&amp;#39;s you know at least her husband
and her daughter haven&amp;#39;t served in the
military at all so her immediate family
hasn&amp;#39;t like give me a break on this she
was deployed in medical unions I mean
that&amp;#39;s what literally where she got that
streak of gray in her hair no me Tulsi
is a like legitimate servant to the
United States of America and the
accusation that she&amp;#39;s not comes from
people who want to send Americans to
Wars that have no connection to our
national interest I mean this is the
biggest difference I think
between K Harrison Donald Trump is
actually foreign policy and that there
are three issues man I I&amp;#39;ve learned this
in my own brief political career there
are three issues where you are not
allowed to challenge The Establishment
one is trade you you know you have to be
pro- free trade everything is good let
as many Chinese slave labor made
products into your country as possible
even if it destroys native indust
industries that is number one the most
important issue to our establishment the
number two most important issue is is
immigration and the number three most
important issue is foreign policy and
maybe actually foreign policy is the
biggest because if you criticize the
wars and you criticize American foreign
entanglements that is where people get
really far what is the root of that you
think I think some of financial right I
mean you know Liz sheney wants her board
seat at Ron and everywhere else that&amp;#39;s
that&amp;#39;s part of what&amp;#39;s driving it of
course her dad was a major owner um or I
believe that he owned a pretty
significant stank in Halle Burton but I
actually think I don&amp;#39;t want to overstate
that because I actually don&amp;#39;t think
that&amp;#39;s most of what&amp;#39;s going on and I I
this is maybe a background view that I
have that I should interrogate a little
bit more but I I tend to think that
people aren&amp;#39;t expressly financially
motivated I think they&amp;#39;re much better at
rationalizing their financial motivation
as somehow good so I don&amp;#39;t think Liz
Cheney to be fair even though I can&amp;#39;t
stand her wakes up and says oh I want to
get rich so I&amp;#39;m going to support the
Ukraine war so that rathon can continue
making all these missiles I think what&amp;#39;s
going on is they have convince
themselves that the post World War II
American
consensus this entire idea that we&amp;#39;re
going to remake the entire world in
America&amp;#39;s image they think that that is
the most important the most valuable
project and they don&amp;#39;t care they&amp;#39;re
going to they&amp;#39;re going to do it as much
as they can even though I think it&amp;#39;s run
its course I think we should have
learned in Iraq we can&amp;#39;t turn everybody
into the United States States of America
nor should we want to but these guys
can&amp;#39;t quite give up on it it&amp;#39;s just a
powerful psychological motivation if you
go back to when the Soviet Union fell
right when the Berlin Wall fell in the
late 80s early
90s there was this sense among American
leaders right Bill Clinton takes over in
1992 that we had reached what was called
at the time the end of history that
Western liberal democracy was going to
Triumph everybody was going to be like
us there was going to be no more ethnic
conflict no more Rel conflict no more
regional conflict and I think these guys
bought the idea so profoundly that they
can&amp;#39;t really wake up and recognize that
for the past 40 years we&amp;#39;ve tried their
theories and their theories haven&amp;#39;t
worked there&amp;#39;s also the craziest thing
that happened to me during this campaign
was when Dick Cheney and dors KLA Harris
and the left went crazy yay dick ch&amp;#39;s on
our side like the craziest thing I know
the guy look at what they said about
Donald Trump how much do you hate Donald
Trump that you&amp;#39;re willing to choose Dick
Cheney over him and that Dick Cheney is
all of a sudden a good guy the the
engineer behind the Iraq war is
responsible for how many people dead um
you know hundreds of thousands maybe
millions of Arabs certainly thousands of
Americans the biggest world historical
catastrophe I think in the history of
the United States of America was the
Iraq War because unlike other mistakes
that we&amp;#39;ve made it was truly unforced
there was no reason in hindsight to do
it there was nothing that we got out of
it we lost I mean so many innocent
people we spent trillions of dollars we
I think destroyed the social cohesion
that we had gotten after 911 because
remember like after 9/11 everybody was
an American we were all on the same team
democrat or republican we destroyed that
and we created in Iraq effectively a
proxy of Iran which it&amp;#39;s telling now
that 20 years later the biggest foreign
policy threat that we face in the Middle
East is Iran and we created a massive
Ally of the Iranians and the Iraqis and
none of the people who actually presided
over that disaster saying oh maybe we
really really screwed up and maybe we
should reevaluate some of our
assumptions there&amp;#39;s only a few days left
um how much of a chance do you think
Trump has to win this um are you
confident or is it close I&amp;#39;m confident I
I&amp;#39;m it is close but I am confident
because it&amp;#39;s close but it&amp;#39;s close in a
way that favors us right the undecided
voters tend to be voters who are more
aligned with us I think the early voting
data looks really good I think that you
know people just fundamentally don&amp;#39;t
want to do more of the same and kamla
Harris is more of the same I think some
of our arguments that KLA Harris is the
voter is the candidate of censorship is
starting to really break through but you
know to your listeners if you agree with
what I&amp;#39;ve said here get out there and
vote because like there is something to
be said for me and Donald Trump actually
sat and had a conversation and you know
hopefully I didn&amp;#39;t make a complete fool
of myself but they just don&amp;#39;t do that
right like why why would we make a
person who&amp;#39;s terrified of talking about
what she wants to do and what she
believes why would we make her president
of the United States the only way to to
to make that not happen is to vote for
me and Trump uh on or before November
the 5th so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very important um I
feel good about it but I don&amp;#39;t feel
great about it because there are a lot
of ways in which Democrats are going to
try to motivate their base down the
stretch there are a lot of ways in which
yeah I mean I I I wouldn&amp;#39;t put it past
them maybe they do try to cheat I don&amp;#39;t
know exactly what it looks like in five
or six days but I know that the best
thing that we can do to prevent that
from happening is to get out there make
our voices heard all right thanks man
thank you very much thanks for being
here appreciate it good see you too all
right bye everybody
